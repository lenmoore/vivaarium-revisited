1
00:00:00.458 --> 00:00:03.666
Alright... welcome to
our capsule!

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:07.166
You can put your phones aside for now.
I'll let you know when they're needed.

3
00:00:08.083 --> 00:00:11.416
So, this is it - 
our community room.

4
00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:17.000
And here is where we'll spend
most of the next 23 years.

5
00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:20.250
We won't just let that time
go to waste.

6
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.333
Our community room is
basically like a classroom.

7
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.583
Or a library.

8
00:00:24.916 --> 00:00:29.791
I've gathered a selection
of humanity's success stories here.

9
00:00:36.083 --> 00:00:40.291
But I've really focused on collecting
a cross-section of humanity's success stories.

10
00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:46.500
There's a special emphasis on technology, engineering, architecture, physics.

11
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.583
Of course, I haven't
forgotten the humanities.

12
00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:53.916
Linguistics, etymology,
a touch of semiotics.

13
00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:55.916
Plenty of history books.

14
00:00:55.916 --> 00:01:01.958
Social history, the rise and fall of civilizations,
organized religion.

15
00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:07.583
Chronicles of wars and
the life cycles of famous dynasties.

16
00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:12.083
You'll find a diverse range of reading material here
for a long time.

17
00:01:12.583 --> 00:01:14.125
We'll analyze what we read
together.

18
00:01:14.125 --> 00:01:18.666
We'll figure out what wisdom
we can extract from these works.

19
00:01:19.083 --> 00:01:25.916
And what practical techniques we can
apply to ensure our own success.

20
00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:28.791
Being in the capsule has
two purposes -

21
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:31.500
The first is to rejuvenate
our planet.

22
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.208
But the second...
and more important one:

23
00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:39.500
Is to elevate the development
of our small community.

24
00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:44.041
For that, we already have
a favorable foundation.

25
00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:45.583
That's all of you.

26
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:52.416
You, you, and of course, you.

27
00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:14.000
...and naturally, you.

28
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.041
You were chosen here consciously,
with your qualities and values in mind.

29
00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:23.458
I can already see that in our capsule,
we have the most ambitious

30
00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:27.000
And the most potential for development
group.

31
00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:33.041
But now it's our responsibility
to ensure that this development actually takes place.

32
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.041
What does it require from us?

33
00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:39.416
It requires us to
change our mindset.

34
00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:44.375
It requires us to
align our thinking.

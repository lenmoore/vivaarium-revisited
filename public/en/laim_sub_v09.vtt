00:00:00.458 --> 00:00:03.458
Team Lime, I can once again
wish you good luck

2
00:00:04.416 --> 00:00:08.083
You have made a very good choice again,
a very promising choice

3
00:00:08.083 --> 00:00:12.375
We have decided that people, when they turn 65,
will go into free retirement

4
00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:14.500
Congratulations to you!

5
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.875
What I still see from here -

6
00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:24.291
Someone is still voting differently...

7
00:00:25.583 --> 00:00:29.458
Someone is still voting differently
and has been doing so from the beginning

8
00:00:31.916 --> 00:00:34.208
I have given them the opportunity to evolve

9
00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:37.750
They have not used that opportunity,
and it's starting to get on my nerves

10
00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:43.708
You see - we have already
made some progress with our group

11
00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:49.000
But we cannot continue if someone
constantly throws a spanner in the works

12
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.291
So, I want to end with a new vote
right here

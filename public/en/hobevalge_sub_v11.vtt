00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.875
There's no Kalevipoeg in the bosom of the land,

2
00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:06.083
nor Northern Frog, no one stands

3
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.583
behind the Estonian's back

4
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.166
We are constantly in danger

5
00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:10.916
Our lands are coveted by

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.541
neighboring usurpers

7
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.208
You know who I'm talking about

8
00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:16.166
Immigrants, culture inundators

9
00:00:16.458 --> 00:00:18.500
They want to wipe us off the face of the Earth

10
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.208
They want our land for themselves

11
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:25.083
Our survival is in our hands

12
00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.500
and we are ready to fight, damn it!

13
00:00:28.583 --> 00:00:30.625
The most crucial war for Estonian history begins!

14
00:00:31.083 --> 00:00:33.375
We declare Estonia a sanctuary

15
00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.666
We may be small, but

16
00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:37.583
our spirit soars to the sky

17
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.541
To be Estonian is proud and noble, resist!

18
00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:44.500
Our garden is small, and the soil is thin

19
00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:47.166
and if we want to reap from it, then

20
00:00:47.458 --> 00:00:49.750
we must keep the weeds away

21
00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:54.916
We uphold Estonian traditions

22
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.541
Estonian land, pure blood,

23
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.041
we uproot anyone who threatens

24
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.250
our land, language, and culture

25
00:01:02.416 --> 00:01:03.875
We want to be Estonians today, tomorrow,

26
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.208
and FOREVER

27
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.583
Together we proclaim that

28
00:01:06.708 --> 00:01:08.458
Estonian forests and seas belong only to Estonians

29
00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:10.125
But we don't lock our gates,

30
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.750
we invite anyone who wants to see

31
00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:13.833
how Europe's oldest indigenous people live

32
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.500
And nothing must be taken

33
00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:17.458
from our sanctuary

34
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.541
Because we're not some damn butcher shop

35
00:01:19.708 --> 00:01:21.583
And you must not leave your foreign trash here

36
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.333
In our sacred grove

37
00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:24.750
When you come here,

38
00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:26.875
you speak with us in clear Estonian

39
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.041
You adhere to Estonian customs,

40
00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:31.166
Estonian traditions

41
00:01:32.208 --> 00:01:34.250
And we don't want your foreign rubbish here

42
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:36.708
This is your only chance

43
00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:39.416
to be a part of the world's finest nation

44
00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:43.375
Creator, protect Estonia!

45
00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:47.916
Only in this way, no other way

46
00:01:49.916 --> 00:01:52.833
Yes, perhaps difficult thoughts for some

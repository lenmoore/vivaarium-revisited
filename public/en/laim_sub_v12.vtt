00:00:04.583 --> 00:00:06.375
And now,
it begins!

2
00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:12.958
I knew it.
I was already anticipating it!

3
00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:16.916
I said those Silver ones
won't hold up.

4
00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:20.625
The Silvers have been
digging holes all the time.

5
00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:23.625
And now, should we help them
get out of there?

6
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.541
No-no! Let them rot
in there now!

7
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:30.541
Let them suffer there!
It serves them right.

8
00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:35.875
You understand - not a single Silver
will be accepted here!

9
00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:37.083
Clear, right?

10
00:00:38.416 --> 00:00:42.833
Not a single Silver!
I hope no one even thinks about it.

11
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.000
You understand - as a group,
we've come somewhere already.

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.375
We can't let those troublemakers in here
who will ruin everything!

13
00:00:52.583 --> 00:00:55.583
If they can't keep their capsules intact,
let them suffer.

14
00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:59.125
The world doesn't need
such scavengers.

15
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.750
Soon the Violet capsule will give up,
the Turquoise capsule will give up.

16
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.250
Then everyone will want to come here.

17
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.250
Damn Vivaverse!

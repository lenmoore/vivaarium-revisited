00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
Wow!

2
00:00:03.208 --> 00:00:04.750
You saw it yourselves!

3
00:00:05.416 --> 00:00:07.958
You saw it,
what I was talking about!

4
00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:11.083
The Lord's menagerie
sure is diverse, isn't it?

5
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.208
What familiar parasitic words
resonated there -

6
00:00:16.208 --> 00:00:18.166
There was -
reproduction

7
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.583
What is reproduction?
It's just expansion

8
00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:23.833
Expansion, in turn, means
growth, you know

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.250
Sometimes I feel like
the basis of the whole world is just growth

10
00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:33.625
You see - everything has to keep
getting bigger, more beautiful, more expensive

11
00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:35.916
Better, more costly

12
00:00:35.916 --> 00:00:37.541
But at whose expense,
my friends?

13
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.541
At whose expense?
No one talks about that

14
00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:44.375
Every aspect of life is squeezed
into the growth curve

15
00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:47.166
Then the masses see that everything
is moving uphill

16
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.708
That's when a person
is happy!

17
00:00:48.708 --> 00:00:50.833
Then they consume!

18
00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:52.875
The whole machinery
turns a profit

19
00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:58.625
Honestly, I don't want to start bashing capitalism
right here

20
00:00:59.416 --> 00:01:01.375
Honestly! I'm not
a socialist

21
00:01:02.916 --> 00:01:06.750
As far as I'm concerned, all these isms
can go wherever!

22
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:08.625
Honestly!

23
00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:13.166
They may look different, but in reality,
they all have the same goal

24
00:01:14.416 --> 00:01:17.833
Keeping the masses
in check

25
00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:19.666
Like pieces
on a chessboard

26
00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:24.291
The only problem is,
there's no opposing player

27
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:30.250
Nature doesn't engage in such
strategy and outsmarting games

28
00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:34.041
Nature's only
principle is...

29
00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:37.958
Balance!

30
00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:42.000
Exactly! Balance!

31
00:01:43.083 --> 00:01:46.083
Humanity senses weakness in this,
which it can exploit

32
00:01:47.416 --> 00:01:50.833
You all know
"The Matrix" movie, right?

33
00:01:50.833 --> 00:01:53.541
There was a character -
Agent Smith

34
00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:54.583
What did he say?

35
00:01:54.583 --> 00:01:56.208
He said it very
aptly

36
00:01:56.208 --> 00:02:03.708
That human activity most closely resembles the life cycle
of a virus in the natural world

37
00:02:03.708 --> 00:02:06.458
It spreads, conquers,
and takes

38
00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:09.833
Ruthlessly, until an oasis
becomes a desert

39
00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:13.666
And now we've
come this far

40
00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:18.000
It's long past midnight,
the carriage is turning into a pumpkin

41
00:02:20.291 --> 00:02:21.625
Honestly -

42
00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:30.125
I believe our biggest enemy
is the lack of education and knowledge

43
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.666
Think about how many people in the world
still, especially those in high positions,

44
00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:39.666
Deny human-induced
climate change

45
00:02:40.416 --> 00:02:44.166
Or even try to prove that
these changes aren't that bad

46
00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:48.791
Changes aren't bad?
That's the talk of a madman!

47
00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:52.458
Such talk can only be made by a person
living a comfortable life

48
00:02:52.458 --> 00:02:54.625
With central heating and
an air-conditioned apartment

49
00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:57.208
Not fighting for their life in areas
of wildfires,

50
00:02:57.208 --> 00:03:00.208
Floods, or
landslides

51
00:03:00.208 --> 00:03:02.583
You see -
it's a complete blind game

52
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.500
Instead of thinking,
there's constant emotionalization

53
00:03:07.291 --> 00:03:10.291
Oh, the lamentation around
drinking straws is just heartbreaking

54
00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:15.375
Some ladies are ready to go on hunger strikes
because of plastic cups

55
00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:18.541
"Oh, dear God, help!
What's going to happen now?

56
00:03:18.541 --> 00:03:21.916
I have to start washing glasses?
Oh dear!"

57
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.500
Yup, dear lady!

58
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.916
A technological solution has long been
devised for that

59
00:03:26.916 --> 00:03:31.291
New dishwashers use much
less water than you splashing it at the sink

60
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.500
I understand that our fight
will be difficult

61
00:03:38.375 --> 00:03:40.833
Because irrationality is thriving
on the other side

62
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:45.333
It's very easy to use all sorts of
Twitter tweets on these topics

63
00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:47.708
To claim that without gasoline,
society collapses

64
00:03:47.708 --> 00:03:49.875
That wind turbines
kill migratory birds

65
00:03:50.875 --> 00:03:54.833
But we must read scientific
research

66
00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:58.833
We must trust facts,
not live in wishful thinking

67
00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:04.166
Of course, the truth is that as a species,
we must give up many comforts

68
00:04:05.375 --> 00:04:08.708
Humans can do with much less
than what they've indulged themselves with

69
00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:13.416
Honestly - we here
are not crazy

70
00:04:13.416 --> 00:04:18.458
No! We're not heading to the Louvre
with a jar of soup to fight climate change

71
00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:21.875
No! We're not sticking ourselves
to the highway asphalt. No!

72
00:04:23.041 --> 00:04:26.958
We educate, educate,
and educate again

73
00:04:28.125 --> 00:04:34.166
Moderately, with reasoning,
because repetition leads to victory

74
00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:37.166
Believe me!

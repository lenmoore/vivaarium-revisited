1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.125
23 years is a long time.

2
00:00:05.416 --> 00:00:06.916
Maybe some of you
aren't that old.

3
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:11.875
23 years! It represents
an entire generational shift!

4
00:00:12.916 --> 00:00:13.916
Doesn't that sound frightening?

5
00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:17.625
For some, even a trip from Tallinn
to Tartu seems unbearable.

6
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:19.208
But don't worry.

7
00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:22.583
We'll make this time here
exciting and practical.

8
00:00:22.583 --> 00:00:26.500
In our capsule, time is used
practically.

9
00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:29.291
Our mornings start early,
before the rooster crows.

10
00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:33.708
And our goal is to avoid
boredom and lethargy.

11
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.500
That's why our program includes
many mental and physical activities.

12
00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:42.125
And routine and self-improvement
are of great importance.

13
00:00:43.083 --> 00:00:50.000
Each of you will discover
the talent that enriches the capsule.

14
00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:54.958
That's why self-analysis
is very important.

15
00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958
There aren't many of us. We need
to work together complementarily.

16
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:03.083
For me, it's essential that
each of you feels useful.

17
00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:07.541
Personal satisfaction is
paramount.

18
00:01:08.416 --> 00:01:12.666
None of our capsule's goals
are too big

19
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.083
Or too complicated.

20
00:01:14.083 --> 00:01:16.500
Together, we can handle anything!
Believe me!

21
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.541
At the end of the journey, when
the door of this capsule opens

22
00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:24.666
We will be the ones who carry
humanity forward victoriously!

23
00:01:29.083 --> 00:01:30.583
Isn't that an exciting prospect? Ah?

24
00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:33.833
But in order for us to get to know
each other better

25
00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:35.875
To see what potential
we have

26
00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:38.041
I have prepared some questions
for you

27
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:41.958
You can pick up your phones.
I'm activating the questionnaire.

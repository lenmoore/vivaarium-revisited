00:00:01.041 --> 00:00:02.791
Vivaverse...

2
00:00:03.458 --> 00:00:06.458
How should we call this thing in Estonian?

3
00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:12.208
It's better not to name the evil thing by its name.

4
00:00:13.791 --> 00:00:16.791
Something has broken in the last couple of decades.

5
00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:19.916
The cultural layer that took millennia to form

6
00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:22.416
has suddenly been almost obliterated overnight.

7
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:26.125
Maybe it's due to the rapid

8
00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:28.708
technological development,

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.333
or perhaps globalization,

10
00:00:31.916 --> 00:00:34.750
maybe it's the crazy wanderlust

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.500
that has gripped all of humanity.

12
00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:40.291
As soon as one can travel to the other side of the world

13
00:00:40.458 --> 00:00:42.041
or delve into the depths of the internet,

14
00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:43.833
no one wants to be where they should truly be.

15
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.708
And the result is here -

16
00:00:45.916 --> 00:00:47.625
suddenly, nationality is no longer important.

17
00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:50.166
You may ask who is spouting such nonsense,

18
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.416
but they are talking... they are talking.

19
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.416
They speak out against song festivals,

20
00:00:58.125 --> 00:00:59.875
undermine unity, national identity,

21
00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:02.375
proclaim some kind of integration.

22
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.750
Until you teach wolves to eat cabbage,

23
00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.416
don't talk to me about damn integration.

24
00:01:08.708 --> 00:01:11.166
Cultural abundance, using the example of the USA -

25
00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:17.791
Alright, yes, the USA is a mighty country.

26
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.958
There are 300 million people there, but

27
00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:25.833
only 2% of them are natives.

28
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.166
Alright, I understand, I understand.

30
00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:33.333
In American terms, 2% is indeed 5.2 million inhabitants,

31
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:35.708
and that's a huge number compared to Estonia.

32
00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:37.708
But there are fewer of us,

33
00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:39.666
and we have survived all the hardships.

34
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.208
Many peoples around us,

35
00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:45.000
like the mighty Livonians,

36
00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:48.083
have been wiped off the world map by invaders,

37
00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:50.541
but they haven't beaten us yet.

38
00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:57.416
Due to the Northern War and the plague,

39
00:01:57.666 --> 00:02:02.625
how many of us were left by the early 18th century?

40
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.791
Many? - 120 thousand.

41
00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958
150 thousand, a little more...

42
00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:12.833
150 thousand! In the early 18th century.

43
00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:18.000
It wasn't very long ago, just now.

44
00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:20.125
And we are still here!

45
00:02:20.208 --> 00:02:23.458
And I ask, how is this possible?

46
00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:27.875
Thanks to our roots.

47
00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:30.625
As soon as the ice sheet retreated from Estonian lands,

48
00:02:30.791 --> 00:02:33.750
our forebears settled our land.

49
00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:37.375
So, our roots and memory

50
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.250
are 11 thousand years old.

51
00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:43.208
As one of the few indigenous peoples in Europe,

52
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.625
we have maintained over this long period

53
00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:48.750
consistency.

54
00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:52.041
In Estonia, viable ethnic communities have also survived,

55
00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:57.291
such as the... Setos,

56
00:02:57.625 --> 00:03:00.708
Saaremaa islanders, Hiiumaa islanders, Mulks.

57
00:03

:00.916 --> 00:03:03.791
And this comes from a trick we've learned

58
00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.083
over centuries:

59
00:03:06.291 --> 00:03:08.583
Let's become Europeans, but remain Estonians.

60
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.375
Estonians adapt externally, not internally.

61
00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:16.291
And that has helped us, an ancient European

62
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.666
indigenous people, remain independent.

63
00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:24.333
I don't want to forbid or command anyone here.

64
00:03:24.583 --> 00:03:26.458
I just want to remind

65
00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:28.916
what a privilege it is to be Estonian.

66
00:03:29.916 --> 00:03:32.250
It's an honor.

67
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.708
It's like winning the lottery -

68
00:03:35.875 --> 00:03:38.333
1.4 million out of 8 billion people.

69
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.958
And I understand, the heart is blind -

70
00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:46.083
sometimes, one falls in love with non-Estonians,

71
00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:48.291
creates cosmopolitan families,

72
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.833
spends long winters in Tenerife.

73
00:03:51.291 --> 00:03:54.166
But we need Estonians here, in Estonia.

74
00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:57.083
And I want to recognize and support

75
00:03:57.375 --> 00:03:59.833
every young Estonian family

76
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:02.500
that has made the decision to stand for Estonian culture

77
00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:04.625
and the land of Estonia.

78
00:04:05.041 --> 00:04:06.958
Dear friends! So that it stays this way,

79
00:04:07.208 --> 00:04:09.250
take out your smartphones again,

80
00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:11.375
I will activate a questionnaire for you.

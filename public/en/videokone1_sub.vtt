00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
ADMIN: Time for the first video link

2
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.208
Captains, give an overview

3
00:00:07.375 --> 00:00:09.166
of your capsule composition

4
00:00:09.458 --> 00:00:10.708
Violet: Greetings from the violet capsule

5
00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:11.833
Lime: Hey there, hey

6
00:00:11.916 --> 00:00:12.916
Silver: Hello, yes

7
00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:14.250
Violet: We have quite the team here

8
00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:16.375
a very ambitious team indeed

9
00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.583
I'm very happy because this

10
00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:21.250
journey will surely be memorable for all of us

11
00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:22.750
Silver: One can assume...

12
00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:24.750
Violet: Let me talk a bit, we have 10 men here,

13
00:00:24.916 --> 00:00:26.791
8 women, very good

14
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.583
And very promising in terms of development

15
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.833
and they are ready to contribute ideologically

16
00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:37.375
11 people, 2 physically and

17
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:41.000
3 think they are just watching others from the sidelines

18
00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:43.625
But we have 23 years to find

19
00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:46.333
our purpose in our community

20
00:00:47.416 --> 00:00:49.916
Routine is important in our capsule

21
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.500
I suggested how we could start our day

22
00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:57.125
and I can say that as a result of a unanimous vote

23
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.500
we will start our day with group gymnastics

24
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.875
Children and the next generation are truly

25
00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.708
important to us

26
00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:07.625
And I asked how many want children,

27
00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:09.333
those who don't, and

28
00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:11.041
those who already have enough children

29
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:12.875
We have quite a few people, 7 people,

30
00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:15.000
who already have enough children

31
00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:17.083
5 people who want to have children and

32
00:01:17.208 --> 00:01:19.208
one is still undecided

33
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.333
But we still have 23 years

34
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.375
to think about what family values are

35
00:01:24.708 --> 00:01:27.833
And so that our children will be healthy in the future,

36
00:01:28.083 --> 00:01:31.708
we, together, are giving up smoking

37
00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:33.375
Thank you!

38
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:35.083
Such a group we have here!

39
00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:37.000
SILVER: Yes, very nice, this is Silver

40
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:39.875
We're all waving, our paws are moving

41
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.791
Things are going well in the Silver capsule

42
00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:47.791
And when you talk about giving up smoking,

43
00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:51.000
then Estonians know that it's always wise

44
00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:53.958
to go fight against smoking in the marsh,

45
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:56.750
find some bog myrtle or willowherb there,

46
00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.541
put it in your nose and inhale, it's delightful

47
00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:03.458
And we conducted a survey here in the Silver capsule

48
00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:06.875
which I had prepared

49
00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:10.333
Will we see Estonia 23 years from now?

50
00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:13.166
I can say that to a 70% extent,

51
00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:15.958
people still see Estonia

52
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.375
There are some deviations, but well,

53
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:20.916
we have time to open our eyes and talk about

54
00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:22.958
what is important and what is just

55
00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:25.208
like the wind in the willow branches

56
00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:27.416
And I promise to give my all, and

57
00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:30.833
the furrows in that field will be straight

58
00:02:31.208 --> 00:02:32.916
VIOLET: Thank you, great thoughts

59
00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:34.708
Limes, how are you?

60
00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:37.083
LIME: Hey there, hey, this is the Lime capsule

61
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.458
I'm glad to hear that you're doing well

62
00:02:39.708 --> 00:02:41.416
and I have to admit that here too

63
00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:42.708
things are going very well

64
00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:44.375
As you can see behind me,

65
00:02:44.583 --> 00:02:46.541
my capsule is filled to the brim with people

66
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.291
Everyone is alive, healthy, and in high spirits

67
00:02:49.541 --> 00:02:51.291
We've settled in quietly,

68
00:02:51.416 --> 00:02:53.166
we've had brainstorming sessions

69
00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:54.750
and we've agreed on fundamental

70
00:02:54.916 --> 00:02:56.208
things like the planet's well-being is more important

71
00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:58.041
than individual well-being

72
00:02:58.208 --> 00:02:59.791
and renewable energy is our future

73
00:02:59.875 --> 00:03:02.166
We intend to be very resource-efficient here

74
00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:04.666
We've agreed to minimize

75
00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:06.708
water usage and artificial lighting

76
00:03:06.916 --> 00:03:08.666
Practically to the minimum

77
00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:10.666
Very sensible, yes, but I'll honestly tell you

78
00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:12.916
we're not just doing hard work here

79
00:03:13.083 --> 00:03:15.291
We have all sorts of other ideas too

80
00:03:15.458 --> 00:03:17.250
We'll definitely be organizing themed evenings,

81
00:03:17.375 --> 00:03:19.166
having stylish parties

82
00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:21.125
and one particularly nice idea, which is entirely mine,

83
00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:23.083
is that we'll set up a little eco-cocktail bar

84
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:25.083
in the corner of our community space

85
00:03:25.416 --> 00:03:27.458
We'll call it "Sly Lime"

86
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:30.333
So it's going to be fun here,

87
00:03:30.625 --> 00:03:32.208
we're in good shape, all is well

88
00:03:32.416 --> 00:03:34.958
HÕBEVALGE: Keep a clear head there!

90
00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:38.750
VIOLET: You mentioned that you're alive,

91
00:03:38.916 --> 00:03:40.458
it would be very strange if you weren't alive

92
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:41.708
after such a short time...

93
00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:43.416
So I'm also very pleased!

94
00:03:43.666 --> 00:03:45.208
But Turquoise, how are you all doing?

95
00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:48.000
TURQUOISE: Well, it's super to hear from you too

96
00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:50.666
We have an absolute dream team here

97
00:03:50.833 --> 00:03:53.291
I mean, a dream team, let's wave!

98
00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:55.833
Very cool!

99
00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:57.625
We're very creative,

100
00:03:57.791 --> 00:03:59.416
a really cool bunch here

101
00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:01.666
Just like the violets, we've decided

102
00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:04.458
to quit smoking together

103
00:04:05.583 --> 00:04:08.208
Actually, there's another similarity we have

104
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.125
You do morning gymnastics, right?

105
00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:14.250
We do yoga and meditation every morning

106
00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:17.500
We're preparing our minds for a real vision

107
00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:20.708
and moving forward into the future

108
00:04:21.208 --> 00:04:23.000
Very cool!

109
00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:25.000
HÕBEVALGE: Cool as ice!

110
00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:27.083
TURQUOISE: Thank you, Hõbevalge, for the clarification,

111
00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:29.083
but right now I wanted to turn to Lime

112
00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:32.625
because the idea of Sly Lime's eco-cocktail bar is cool

113
00:04:32.916 --> 00:04:36.166
Maybe we should start something like that ourselves

114
00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:39.625
here, very awesome!

115
00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:41.208
LIME: Thank you, thank you!

116
00:04:41.375 --> 00:04:43.500
VIOLET: Indeed! But the schedule needs to be fulfilled

117
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.375
so I thank you for this meeting

118
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:48.583
here on the screen, and I believe we'll hear

119
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:50.458
and see more

120
00:04:50.708 --> 00:04:54.583
HÕBEVALGE: Early birds fly far

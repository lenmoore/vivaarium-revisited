00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:04.833
I am absolutely convinced that all of you
here believe it too.

2
00:00:04.833 --> 00:00:08.166
Because otherwise, you wouldn't
have ended up in the Lime Capsule.

3
00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:11.541
I also have evidence of that.

4
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.666
I have data here,
I have the data here.

5
00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:20.000
Before coming into this capsule, you were able
to choose various items for yourselves.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I have all the items you selected
right here.

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.541
We can now take a look at
what items we have in this capsule.

8
00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:28.833
Look what we have here...

9
00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:33.625
The most popular item brought along,
15 people actually brought it -

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.916
First aid manual.

11
00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:40.083
Not a bad choice.

12
00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:43.416
We have quite a few of them,
maybe one would have sufficed.

13
00:00:44.416 --> 00:00:48.125
So, shall we all study
this first aid kit here?

14
00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:51.708
Another very popular item is
sunglasses.

15
00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:55.208
Sunglasses in this capsule?
Why not...

16
00:00:57.375 --> 00:00:58.916
Also quite popular are
pocket knives.

17
00:00:58.916 --> 00:01:01.125
12 people brought
pocket knives.

18
00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:04.125
That's a good choice.
I would have made the same choice.

19
00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:07.125
Nice, multifunctional tool.

20
00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:12.541
Woolen socks -
10 people brought them.

21
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:16.041
7 people brought sweatpants.
Very cozy, homely vibe.

22
00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:19.041
Here, we can comfortably
stay for 23 years.

23
00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:20.791
9 hammocks.

24
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:23.791
We'll hang those somewhere around here.

25
00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:26.750
What else - 
many have chosen earphones.

26
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.458
You shouldn't have.
We already have earphones.

27
00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:31.916
But how could you
have known that?

28
00:01:31.916 --> 00:01:34.208
6 handfuls of hallucinogenic mushrooms.

29
00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:39.375
We'll use those! They'll surely
expand our horizons.

30
00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:42.333
Connect us more with
nature.

31
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:45.333
Then we have 6 Swiss army knives,
5 revolvers.

32
00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:47.166
I hope we won't
need those.

33
00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:51.958
What do I see - 4 people
brought seeds and nuts.

34
00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958
A very good choice!

35
00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.916
I already have an idea
for what to do with them.

36
00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:02.625
4 people brought
100 liters of whisky.

37
00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:05.625
A total of 400 liters of whisky.

38
00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.458
Where are our whisky enthusiasts
among us?

39
00:02:07.458 --> 00:02:10.333
No. 7 is a big
whisky enthusiast.

40
00:02:11.208 --> 00:02:14.208
13 is a big
whisky enthusiast.

41
00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:19.125
97, 142 -
whisky enthusiasts!

42
00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:23.666
What else?
A couple of Rubik's cubes, a few soccer balls.

43
00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:26.958
Accordion, guitar -
we can almost start a band.

44
00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:33.250
Looking at the choices, it seems that we have
a capsule with quite like-minded individuals.

1
00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:04.500
Just... everything? Okay... Well

2
00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:17.208
I really don't have anything to add to this nonsense

3
00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:22.333
We're here working, aren't we,

4
00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:26.166
putting in effort, finding the path to the future

5
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:30.000
and what's the reaction, well...

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.083
Not that they can't just understand

7
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.791
the concept of virtual reality, but

8
00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:39.875
they simply laugh

9
00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:42.250
at the efforts of others

10
00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:45.041
Such ignorance...

11
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:48.125
I know, we think about it like this,

12
00:00:48.416 --> 00:00:52.958
that the other capsules aren't ready yet

13
00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:55.875
to step into our future

14
00:00:56.791 --> 00:01:00.166
And maybe that's okay

15
00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:05.458
We are, so far, the light at the end of the tunnel,

16
00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:09.250
showing them the way to the future

17
00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:12.333
Because guys, just think about it -

18
00:01:12.583 --> 00:01:15.375
my first mobile phone in 2001

19
00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:18.791
had a ridiculous antenna, a black and white screen,

20
00:01:18.916 --> 00:01:22.083
and monotonous ringtones

21
00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.916
That device was so big, you see,

22
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.416
that I could have knocked someone out with it

23
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.375
if needed

24
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.125
And where have we gotten to

25
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.166
in just 22 years!

26
00:01:33.791 --> 00:01:35.666
Absolutely crazy development, you know.

27
00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:39.000
IT folks even have their own term for it -

28
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.041
Moore's Law:

29
00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:44.541
Microchips double in power every two years.

30
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:47.083
Twice as powerful, indeed!

31
00:01:47.416 --> 00:01:49.833
It's an exponential bang!

32
00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:51.875
Modern people are accustomed to

33
00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:54.500
Smart-ID, 4G, instant transfers.

34
00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:58.291
The world is enormous, it's vast,

35
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.916
yet it fits into a pocket-sized phone.

36
00:02:02.458 --> 00:02:05.333
This is just an absolutely insane era!

37
00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.333
And when you think about it, over

38
00:02:07.416 --> 00:02:11.041
half of the communications happening on the internet

39
00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:14.750
are between machines, not people.

40
00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:17.666
Guys, it's just a bit crazy to me

41
00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:20.375
that humans have created such technology

42
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.041
that has long surpassed them in development.

43
00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:25.750
We should catch up a bit, you know!

44
00:02:25.916 --> 00:02:27.833
And this leap towards technology -

45
00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.000
it's possible. I believe it!

46
00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:32.583
It's only possible if we

47
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:35.541
are willing to become Homo Futuris!

48
00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:38.833
How do we do that? Easy peasy!

49
00:02:39.583 --> 00:02:42.333
We need to go even further.

50
00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:45.250
We must go beyond.

51
00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:46.916
when virtual reality

52
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:49.000
We need to consider compatibility

53
00:02:49.208 --> 00:02:50.708
with technology. Dear friends!

54
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.583
We need to become androids!

55
00:02:57.625 --> 00:03:00.166
And I understand... I understand

56
00:03:00.458 --> 00:03:03.000
This idea is a bit out there

57
00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:05.958
But c'mon, think about it!

58
00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:09.458
Once upon a time, the idea of a 4G phone seemed completely crazy

59
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.333
No one could imagine

60
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.583
what we have today

61
00:03:14.791 --> 00:03:16.875
The world, it needs a bit of craziness

62
00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:19.208
And we are sitting in some ultra-capsule right now

63
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.583
Where else can we think of such things?

64
00:03:21.833 --> 00:03:24.250
Where else can we try them out in practice?

65
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.875
Speaking of crazy ideas...

66
00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:31.958
To take the first step now

67
00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:34.875
on the path to the future human's androidization,

68
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.875
I would suggest that here in this capsule,

69
00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:40.833
for the next 23 years and beyond,

70
00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:44.208
reproduction should only occur

71
00:03:44.416 --> 00:03:46.416
through artificial insemination.

72
00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:48.791
Why?

73
00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:51.375
Friends, genes can be hacked.

74
00:03:51.583 --> 00:03:53.583
Let technology assist us from day one.

75
00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:56.125
We can eliminate all human errors from the start!

76
00:03:56.458 --> 00:03:59.500
But what does this actually mean for us?

77
00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:02.583
We could put an end to diseases

78
00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:04.666
like Down syndrome, Rett syndrome,

79
00:04:05.083 --> 00:04:07.916
all genetic inherited diseases

80
00:04:08.208 --> 00:04:10.458
already today!

81
00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:13.041
We provide all future children

82
00:04:13.125 --> 00:04:15.333
with an equal starting kit for life, right?

83
00:04:15.583 --> 00:04:19.208
Being born healthy, strong, and capable of development.

84
00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:21.875
Of course, some people might resist the idea

85
00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:23.875
They wouldn't understand this concept

86
00:04:24.416 --> 00:04:27.708
But here we have a more enlightened group

87
00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:30.166
Let's grab our smart devices

88
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.708
and start voting for this cause

89
00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:34.166
One small step for man,

90
00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:37.416
one friggin' giant leap for mankind!

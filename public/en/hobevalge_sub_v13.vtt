00:00:01.041 --> 00:00:03.500
The percentages are small...

2
00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:06.166
51% - 48%

3
00:00:06.458 --> 00:00:08.916
14 people are behind me

4
00:00:09.083 --> 00:00:11.125
and are taking over other capsules

5
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.375
Thank you-thank you very much!

6
00:00:13.583 --> 00:00:16.083
13 people decide to overthrow me

7
00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:22.500
Damn, there are silly-Jacks everywhere

8
00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:26.291
You see how the number of them has grown

9
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.041
Everyone whose numbers I call, stand up

10
00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:32.625
37, 72, 53, 2, 33,

11
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:36.125
11, 31, 47, 49, 43,

12
00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:39.583
54, 81, STAND UP, DAMMIT!

13
00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.916
Take off your headphones, get out, the door is there, dammit

14
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.916
Get out of here, dammit!

15
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.875
ADMIN: Attention, the experiment is over

16
00:00:50.291 --> 00:00:52.833
More precisely, the experiment has been

17
00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:55.333
interrupted for technical reasons

18
00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:58.166
Apparently, the capsules still need calibration

19
00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:00.500
You can leave the capsule

20
00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:02.708
and leave the headphones in the capsule

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.375
Please take a seat in the hall!

22
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.708
This is not an exercise right now,

23
00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:09.208
but I hope this issue will be resolved soon

24
00:01:09.416 --> 00:01:11.000
Thank you for your support!

25
00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:12.666
Leave your headphones here and exit now

26
00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:14.541
We will talk later...

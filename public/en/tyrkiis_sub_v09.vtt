00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.833
No questions, wow, yay!

2
00:00:02.958 --> 00:00:05.166
You're all monsters of my vision

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:08.000
We're moving forward; the future awaits!

4
00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:12.291
90% of you say YES to the energy generator

5
00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:16.208
That, my friends, is a powerful percentage!

6
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:20.750
However, not everything is so rosy...

7
00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:25.708
Stand up! Bring your smart devices!

8
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.791
Among us, there is now one individual

9
00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:31.958
who has never belonged from the start

10
00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:33.875
to the ranks of our creators

11
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:38.333
How he ended up in this capsule, I don't know

12
00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.166
But I was very generous

13
00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.625
and allowed him to evolve among us

14
00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:46.041
But he, he hasn't evolved...

15
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.833
Furthermore, he has consistently voted

16
00:00:47.916 --> 00:00:49.416
against our principles,

17
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.500
sabotaged our efforts,

18
00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:54.000
and woven intrigues among us

19
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.125
My patience is wearing thin; I don't know

20
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.125
what to do with him

21
00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.625
And I kindly ask you to take out your smart devices

22
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.166
There you'll find the vote

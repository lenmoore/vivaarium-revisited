00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.208
I want to praise and
acknowledge everyone else's choices

2
00:00:05.208 --> 00:00:11.208
I want to tell you -
In fact, we have always been right

3
00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.958
We were ignored for decades,
and now it's too late

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.541
Giant corporations have swallowed
whole countries, continents

5
00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:24.875
Now they devour forests, resources,
oceans, deserts

6
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.250
Everything is sucked dry
to the last drop

7
00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:33.958
Like a sock and a sock hole - one devours the other
until there's nothing left

8
00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958
That is the true face
of capitalism

9
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:41.166
This is the real face
of capitalism!

10
00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:50.458
Our assistance was spurned, and now
we are choosing a different strategy

11
00:00:51.416 --> 00:00:53.375
We say goodbye to this
vicious circle

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We bid farewell to those
who refuse to change!

13
00:00:57.583 --> 00:01:01.208
The ecological catastrophe will swallow them up
sooner or later, but we will remain

14
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:04.041
We will remain
right here!

15
00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:08.208
You understand -
Team Lime!

16
00:01:08.875 --> 00:01:11.875
In our community, there's no selfishness,
no ideologies

17
00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:14.333
There's no surplus
offspring

18
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:19.458
Our community optimizes, our community
engages in sustainable downsizing

19
00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:24.791
Man is not a god. No!
Man is not a king

20
00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:26.416
He isn't even
a master!

21
00:01:26.416 --> 00:01:30.541
Man is just a speck,
he's a seed

22
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:33.541
A seed for our future's
brighter soil

23
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.250
Humanity in its current form will perish,
but we will endure

24
00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:41.125
We will plant that seed
in the soil again

25
00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:44.125
Team Lime, we are building
our Vivarium

26
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:48.958
Much larger than this one.
And it's meant only for us!

27
00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.291
Dissenters have no place
there!

28
00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:55.708
When society has fallen flat on its face,
they'll come knocking at our door

29
00:01:56.791 --> 00:02:00.791
They'll plead, whimper,
beg for entry

30
00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:03.791
But no.
We won't let them!

31
00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:05.125
We say - NO!

32
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.083
We say - you could have
prevented all of this

33
00:02:08.083 --> 00:02:11.416
But now it's already too late.
Too late!

34
00:02:11.416 --> 00:02:12.916
Team Lime,
damn it!

35
00:02:12.916 --> 00:02:16.250
Now we'll see it through.
Now it's just us

36
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.125
We will transform the entire world
into one grand Vivarium

37
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.666
We're starting from scratch. We'll make
this world in our own image

38
00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:27.666
No place for parasites,
Team Lime!

39
00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:31.916
You understand - everything will start to grow,
everything will flourish, bloom

40
00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:35.458
All thanks to
us!

00:00:01.791 --> 00:00:06.500
Hello, hello! Welcome to
the Lime Capsule

2
00:00:07.583 --> 00:00:10.083
I'll be honest - I'm delighted
to see you all here

3
00:00:10.083 --> 00:00:13.083
Because there are
so many of you here

4
00:00:13.083 --> 00:00:14.833
And what am I
thinking right now?

5
00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:22.083
I'm thinking, has the Vivaarium project
really brought hope to the planet and humanity?

6
00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:26.208
To me, it seems that
the signs are favorable

7
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:31.833
I'm absolutely thrilled at the scale
of this project

8
00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:39.375
Because only by acting globally and together
can we halt this environmental catastrophe

9
00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:44.208
And here we are now,
for a common purpose

10
00:00:45.208 --> 00:00:47.125
The next 23 years

11
00:00:48.375 --> 00:00:53.500
In my opinion, this capsule is a bit
like Noah's Ark

12
00:00:54.458 --> 00:00:58.750
In the sense that if we remain committed
to our mission, we'll abandon greed

13
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.333
We'll avoid comfort - then, at last,
we'll return to paradise

14
00:01:05.083 --> 00:01:08.083
But for now, our paradise is
this small space here

15
00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:11.500
This is our headquarters; this is where
we'll get down to business

16
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:15.333
In this community space, we will
start working on our own affairs

17
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.791
So, what exactly are we doing here?

18
00:01:20.416 --> 00:01:22.583
You all know about Greta Thunberg,
of course

19
00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:29.208
Whose courage and determination brought millions
of environmentally conscious people to the streets

20
00:01:29.208 --> 00:01:31.583
Demanding prioritization of the climate

21
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:35.375
According to her, the situation
is very serious

22
00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:37.708
So serious that we have reason
to panic right now

23
00:01:37.708 --> 00:01:40.708
Because currently, too little is being done
to solve the problem

24
00:01:41.708 --> 00:01:45.166
And she's absolutely right!

25
00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:49.041
Politicians and decision-makers must
start listening to science

26
00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:52.041
They must start acting
based on science

27
00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:57.833
One very simple finding of science is
that we all depend on nature

28
00:01:59.458 --> 00:02:03.583
Unfortunately, our planet's
wild nature and biodiversity are vanishing

29
00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:05.458
This is the true tragedy
of our time

30
00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:08.833
This is an existential crisis
for humanity

31
00:02:10.583 --> 00:02:16.833
My all-time favourite, BBC legend
David Attenborough

32
00:02:16.833 --> 00:02:20.375
Whom you all probably know
from various nature documentaries

33
00:02:20.375 --> 00:02:23.833
One of the most widely traveled people
in the world, I imagine

34
00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:28.166
He has dedicated his entire long career
to educating the public

35
00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:30.666
About the devastation of
human-induced climate change

36
00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:36.166
He says that we live comfortable lives
while awaiting a catastrophe of our own making

37
00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:39.458
He says we can continue
as we are

38
00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:41.625
Happily raise our children

39
00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:44.625
Engage in honest work in a society
we've created

40
00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:48.250
All the while choosing to ignore
the impending catastrophe at our doorstep

41
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.250
Or -
we all change!

42
00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:57.208
He is convinced that as a species,
we can learn from our mistakes

43
00:02:57.208 --> 00:03:00.083
As a species, we can reduce
greenhouse gases

44
00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:03.916
As a species, we can halt
a massive extinction event

45
00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:07.500
I'll be honest -
I believe that too!

46
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.000
Exactly the same way

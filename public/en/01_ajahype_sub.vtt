1
00:00:06.916 --> 00:00:09.916
Time flies in the vivarium.

2
00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:14.708
The days are packed, there's much to explore.

3
00:00:15.208 --> 00:00:18.375
No one wants to laze in their private chamber.

4
00:00:18.708 --> 00:00:20.625
Together, we cook,

5
00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:23.666
together, we care for the capsule.

6
00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:27.000
Together, we sit in the community room.

7
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.666
And we discuss worldly matters.

8
00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:33.083
How many people think like you?

9
00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:35.833
Especially your seat neighbor.

10
00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:37.958
In a short time, you've discovered

11
00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:40.166
many shared interests.

12
00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:43.416
Perhaps this is the beginning of a great friendship.

13
00:00:43.708 --> 00:00:46.208
Maybe even something more...

14
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:51.500
In this vivarium, anything is possible.

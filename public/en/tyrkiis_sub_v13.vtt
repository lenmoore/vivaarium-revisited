00:00:00.791 --> 00:00:04.166
Well, let's see what you thought

2
00:00:14.125 --> 00:00:17.375
Friends, we have a tie

3
00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.708
But you seem to have forgotten,

4
00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.708
that my vote counts too

5
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.000
Of course, the Captain won't be toppled

6
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:28.208
But those rising to their feet:

7
00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:30.041
22

8
00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:31.541
91

9
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:32.916
89

10
00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:34.541
82

11
00:00:34.708 --> 00:00:35.791
32

12
00:00:35.916 --> 00:00:37.250
75

13
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.666
36

14
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.750
2

15
00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:41.208
58

16
00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:42.625
37

17
00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:44.041
25 and 88

18
00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:45.833
Stand up!

19
00:00:46.416 --> 00:00:48.458
To the corner of the capsule, now!

20
00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:50.458
The rest of you, who stayed behind me,

21
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.250
come here, quickly, quickly, QUICKLY!

22
00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:55.333
What do you think of yourselves now, toppling me

23
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.958
and bringing Silver here, just to...

24
00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:00.500
Die off, you waste!

25
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.791
And now we're going to have a meeting here,

26
00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.083
what to do with this damn mess...

27
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.583
SIT DOWN!

28
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.541
Into the energy generator, that's the only idea

29
00:01:12.416 --> 00:01:14.708
Dear friends, thank you for staying behind me

30
00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:19.000
ADMIN: Attention, the experiment has ended

31
00:01:19.416 --> 00:01:21.958
More precisely, the experiment has been

32
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.458
interrupted for technical reasons

33
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.291
Apparently, the capsules still need calibration

34
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:29.625
You can exit the capsule

35
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.833
and leave the headphones in the capsule

36
00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:33.958
Please take your seats in the hall!

37
00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:36.708
Darlings - we'll continue with you,

38
00:01:36.916 --> 00:01:39.291
the rest - OUT OF MY CAPSULE!

39
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:42.416
I don't want this stagnation leeching into my capsule

40
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:44.291
You, you waste, won't come back anymore!

41
00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:46.541
But you, darlings, go,

42
00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:48.666
right now, you have to get out

43
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.791
Thank you, we'll talk with you later

1
00:00:00.916 --> 00:00:05.875
Thank you! We have eradicated
every last obstacle from our capsule

2
00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:08.166
Our family has achieved perfection

3
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:11.166
We came here because
we share a common mindset

4
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.625
We have a common work rhythm

5
00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:15.625
And each of us has
our place

6
00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:20.833
And we love our place because
it gives us meaning

7
00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:23.416
Modern people have
lost their footing

8
00:00:23.416 --> 00:00:26.958
They have created unrealistic,
individual ideals for themselves

9
00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.916
And they tear themselves apart because of it

10
00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:32.291
But these ideals never come true because
they are unrealistic and exaggerated

11
00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:35.166
They live in their
self-created hells

12
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:38.500
Where they are never good enough
or valuable enough

13
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.916
But we, defenders of traditional values

14
00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:42.833
Don't make that mistake.

15
00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:46.375
Maintaining faith and
a clear conscience

16
00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:48.833
Which some have turned away from

17
00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:51.833
And their faith ship
has sunk

18
00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:54.083
We are better than them.
That's a fact!

19
00:00:54.083 --> 00:00:58.125
We are invincible because each of us
in this clan has their role!

20
00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:02.041
We know that the secret to true happiness
is submitting to your role

21
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:05.041
A child submits to their parent.
A woman submits to her husband

22
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:06.541
An employee submits to their boss

23
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:10.000
We are like a fist!
And they envy us

24
00:01:10.708 --> 00:01:12.458
They want to get under our skin

25
00:01:12.458 --> 00:01:15.458
They threaten us!
They want to rob us!

26
00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:18.458
But we won't be swayed
from our path

27
00:01:18.458 --> 00:01:20.208
We don't believe in false teachings

28
00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:22.541
Fads like
toxic feminism

29
00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:25.458
Fake liberalism,
globalist propaganda

30
00:01:25.458 --> 00:01:28.458
We won't succumb
to a slave mentality

31
00:01:28.458 --> 00:01:32.500
Our message to all those
in the opposing trenches is crystal clear:

32
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.250
Fads will die out anyway!

33
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.250
The future belongs to
traditions!

00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:03.000
Thank you for your trust

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.666
and welcome to our new home

3
00:00:07.416 --> 00:00:10.416
Isn't this a beautiful and charming place

4
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.833
just like an altar in the heart of the grove

5
00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:16.958
And here we are, the council of the wise

6
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.208
Sitting and deliberating

7
00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:21.666
23 years, by holy Taara,

8
00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:23.958
still makes me laugh

9
00:00:24.416 --> 00:00:26.500
Incomprehensible greatness for a simple pagan

10
00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.166
What can one do with all this time here?

11
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.333
Read all five parts of "Truth and Justice"?

12
00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.791
No, don't you worry about boredom

13
00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:36.541
nor among us Estonians

14
00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:38.291
will it ever become dull

15
00:00:38.541 --> 00:00:41.916
We always have something to argue about

16
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.291
We Estonians have plenty of stories

17
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.541
to draw from...

18
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.458
... or pull out of our sleeves

19
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.541
Inhabitants of Maarjamaa are especially fond of stories

20
00:00:54.791 --> 00:00:57.833
And our culture is largely oral

21
00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:00.416
There's no other nation in the world

22
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.416
that would come home from work during the week, 

23
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.125
toss their jacket on the chair, grab a basket

24
00:01:04.208 --> 00:01:06.000
and head to the woods to hunt for mushrooms

25
00:01:06.708 --> 00:01:10.083
Or who can distinguish between blueberries, cranberries,

26
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.000
and what was that third one... lingonberries

27
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.666
Or about snakes, adders

28
00:01:17.208 --> 00:01:20.250
and what was that third one... grass snakes

29
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.833
Travel around the world a bit, then

30
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:26.750
you'll realize how well an Estonian knows their homeland

31
00:01:27.791 --> 00:01:30.666
It's a valuable skill, worth preserving

32
00:01:30.916 --> 00:01:32.708
and that's what we must do for the next

33
00:01:32.833 --> 00:01:34.625
23 years, to keep it warm

34
00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.750
Music is also suitable for banishing boredom

35
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:38.833
We Estonians are a singing people

36
00:01:39.916 --> 00:01:41.500
It's a pleasure to see now

37
00:01:41.708 --> 00:01:43.166
what you have brought back from the store

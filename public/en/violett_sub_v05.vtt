1
00:00:03.958 --> 00:00:08.666
Quite an interesting bunch
they've gathered in these capsules, don't you think?

2
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:11.041
A lot of interesting ideas.

3
00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:14.333
Wishing them success and strength.

4
00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:18.083
Interesting theories - like climate change.

5
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.750
That's the original reason why
we're stuck in this capsule, right?

6
00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:28.083
Climate change, climate change...
In my opinion, the world is a bit off-kilter as it is.

7
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.250
But what is causing this
global crisis, really?

8
00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:33.333
They say it's human greed.

9
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.166
Overproduction, exploitation.

10
00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:38.916
Powerful words, all of them.

11
00:00:38.916 --> 00:00:43.083
But what are the consequences
of these human misbehaviors?

12
00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:48.291
I believe it's the alienation
from family structure.

13
00:00:48.416 --> 00:00:51.291
Seriously! The current zeitgeist
supports this at every step!

14
00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:54.291
We've entered the era of slogans,
the era of catchphrases.

15
00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:56.708
The post-truth world.

16
00:00:57.166 --> 00:01:01.500
Social media has instilled in us
the feeling that only those

17
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.791
Who have the loudest voice have
the right to speak the truth.

18
00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958
Everything seems complicated
and confusing.

19
00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.458
Because humans lack a reference point.

20
00:01:10.458 --> 00:01:13.333
But people need a pillar to lean on!

21
00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:19.333
Whether that pillar is God, a king, a general,

22
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:23.083
The head of the family, or even
just a daily schedule.

23
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.625
Lately, all that's being done
is the toppling of authorities

24
00:01:27.625 --> 00:01:28.875
And the deconstruction of concepts.

25
00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:31.875
Listen - they're saying there's
not even such a thing as a woman anymore.

26
00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:38.583
But I am a woman!
And I am proud of my gender role!

27
00:01:40.541 --> 00:01:44.333
I want to be at home.
I want to raise children.

28
00:01:46.208 --> 00:01:50.208
But now I can't because
modern men don't want to lead.

29
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:53.208
So, I have to take the reins.

30
00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:56.125
Because I want our future to be secure!

31
00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:58.958
I want to feel safe.

32
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.958
That's why we need both men and women.

33
00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:10.000
But look - a young person hears propaganda
about gender fluidity and gets confused.

34
00:02:10.458 --> 00:02:14.583
Millennials are grappling with all sorts
of psychological issues

35
00:02:15.291 --> 00:02:17.583
In order to create their own sense of well-being.

36
00:02:17.583 --> 00:02:21.791
They've chosen apathy and indecisiveness.

37
00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:27.250
This has led to the generation
of 35-year-old children.

38
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.750
And crises continue with
the generations born in this millennium.

39
00:02:33.583 --> 00:02:37.125
In such a world, everyone loses control.

40
00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.000
People are constantly confused.

41
00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:43.541
Because they are manipulable.

42
00:02:44.458 --> 00:02:47.958
All our energy goes
to overthinking, displacement activities.

43
00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:49.750
Idle chatter.

44
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.916
It makes me laugh when some academics
and opinion leaders

45
00:02:53.916 --> 00:02:56.833
Talk about some kind of innovation.

46
00:02:56.833 --> 00:02:59.833
"We need a new mindset,
new solutions."

47
00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:02.333
This is another result of the post-truth era.

48
00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:04.458
It's much simpler -

49
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:09.625
Trust what has been working
for many years.

50
00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:13.250
Trust in the power of tradition.

51
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.875
You understand this, don't you?
That's why you came into this capsule.

52
00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:30.333
I'm glad that we can continue
our common intellectual work for the next 23 years.

53
00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:35.041
Both in theory and practice.

00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:05.833
Not quite 23 years, but still a commendable journey,

2
00:00:06.125 --> 00:00:09.791
but this journey is a praiseworthy achievement

3
00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:13.791
Thank you for your contribution and patience!

4
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:16.833
The data received from you will help us in the future

5
00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.750
in making better choices

6
00:00:18.916 --> 00:00:20.458
Vivaarium thanks you!

7
00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:22.541
Mankind thanks you!

8
00:00:29.916 --> 00:00:32.666
Choices, choices, choices...

9
00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:35.958
They shape our lives

10
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.583
What a worn-out truth, 

11
00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:41.125
but truth nonetheless

12
00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.916
Vivaarium continues to evolve

13
00:00:44.416 --> 00:00:46.666
Vivaarium continues to innovate

14
00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:51.833
You will encounter Vivaarium again in the future

15
00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:54.125
Perhaps under a different name,

16
00:00:54.458 --> 00:00:56.666
or in an alternative form,

17
00:00:57.041 --> 00:00:59.791
but Vivaarium changes every day

18
00:01:00.083 --> 00:01:03.041
becoming an increasingly central part of your life

19
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:06.458
One day, Vivaarium will track your decisions

20
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.375
and create a new profile based on them

21
00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:12.291
One day, Vivaarium will build

22
00:01:12.416 --> 00:01:14.583
your very own information bubble

23
00:01:14.916 --> 00:01:17.583
One day, only Vivaarium will know,

24
00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:21.250
who you are becoming tomorrow

25
00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:23.750
Who knows, perhaps we're already

26
00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.791
living in Vivaarium

27
00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:30.583
Who knows, who knows, who knows...

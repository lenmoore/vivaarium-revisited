00:00:10.791 --> 00:00:12.583
Yes!

2
00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:15.083
It has begun!

3
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.916
I told you that the other capsules

4
00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:18.625
are dying out, and this process starts today

5
00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:20.625
It starts with the Silver capsule

6
00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:22.625
Yes!

7
00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:24.500
You know, honestly, I couldn't have imagined

8
00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:26.291
that it would happen so quickly

9
00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:28.041
Okay, what do we have...

10
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.708
one body for three months of energy

11
00:00:30.916 --> 00:00:33.375
What, like 27 guys in there right now?

12
00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:36.666
First, we push the energy generator

13
00:00:36.916 --> 00:00:39.208
with that damn captain from the Silver

14
00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.416
Okay... calm down, calm down

15
00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.416
So, let's think ahead

16
00:00:43.708 --> 00:00:45.416
I wonder how long it could take

17
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:47.250
for all these guys to die out there?

18
00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:48.833
Is it a matter of hours?

19
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.250
Is it a matter of days?

20
00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:51.708
In any case, some guys have to go

21
00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:53.125
and collect those bodies before the others

22
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.583
get a whiff of the smell, right?

23
00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:56.166
And I mean that literally

24
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.125
93, 28, let's see, 72

25
00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:02.208
You guys are potentially the corpse carriers

26
00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:04.666
Now we have to think about how

27
00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.458
to accelerate this process in the other capsules,

28
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:10.166
how to make them die out faster

29
00:01:10.416 --> 00:01:12.000
This is fantastic!

30
00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:13.041
I wouldn't have expected...

31
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.541

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I am convinced that all of you
here are well aware

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.166
That eco-consciousness and sustainability
haven't been mere buzzwords for a long time

3
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.208
And not just
a passing trend

4
00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:13.458
A person who thinks green isn't
an extremist by any means

5
00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:16.458
But clearly the conscience
of the planet,

6
00:00:16.458 --> 00:00:18.416
the societal focal point

7
00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:21.333
We have all the information
we could ever need

8
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.666
All the calculations have been
done by us

9
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:25.666
All alternatives have been
presented by us

10
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:31.833
And now, our task is to think
about how to serve this information to others

11
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.333
Fortunately, we have 23 years
to establish ourselves here

12
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.708
Honestly, this capsule here,
our home, it's already functioning

13
00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:44.791
There's nothing more
we can do here

14
00:00:45.583 --> 00:00:50.291
I am convinced that 23 years from now,
it will be just as good here as it is now

15
00:00:50.291 --> 00:00:52.416
Maybe even
better

16
00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:56.958
But only if we respect
the fundamental principles of sustainability

17
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:03.500
Honestly, I have my own fears
about the other capsules

18
00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:09.291
Unfortunately, it seems like they just party,
wasting resources recklessly

19
00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:12.916
But here, we want the Vivaarium
project to succeed for real

20
00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:17.500
So, our task is to
keep all the others on the right track

21
00:01:21.583 --> 00:01:23.375
Faces turned
worried?

22
00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:25.250
No reason, no-no!

23
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.375
We're not just going to have debates here
or paint posters for demonstrations

24
00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:30.791
Far from it!

25
00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:33.958
We're definitely going to organize
stylish parties here

26
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We'll definitely have
themed evenings

27
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.291
And right here, in the corner of the community room,
we could even set up a small eco-cocktail bar

28
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.708
We could name it
Sly Lime

29
00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:48.875
I believe we'll have
a great time here, no doubt

30
00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:51.375
Right?
What do you guys think?

31
00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:53.166
Of course!
With such a company!

32
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:55.041
How else could it be?

33
00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.833
But before we start building
that eco-cocktail bar with the guys

34
00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:00.375
And move on with our lives
here

35
00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:02.666
I would like to ask you
a couple of questions

36
00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:04.208
These are very simple
questions

37
00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:09.708
They are meant to help us understand
where we currently stand with our thinking

38
00:02:09.708 --> 00:02:12.708
And where we ultimately
should be heading?

39
00:02:12.708 --> 00:02:14.583
Is it possible to change capsules?

40
00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:18.500
Changing capsules
is no longer possible

41
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.541
Your choices have brought you
here

42
00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:25.500
So - please take out your phones,

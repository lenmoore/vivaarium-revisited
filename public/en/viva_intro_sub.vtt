00:00:04.541 --> 00:00:08.458
Welcome to the Vivarium!

2
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.375
What is the Vivarium?

3
00:00:12.916 --> 00:00:15.333
A chance for survival

4
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.333
Hope for a long and successful symbiosis

5
00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:22.583
on this beautiful blue planet

6
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.666
Because if we, as the human species

7
00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.250
don't take action immediately,

8
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:32.333
we will soon lose our home

9
00:00:32.916 --> 00:00:36.083
It's not science fiction; it's inevitability

10
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.291
What is the Vivarium?

11
00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:43.916
Innovative, state-of-the-art technology

12
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.583
Built on the principle of zero energy,

13
00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:51.041
completely self-sustaining and self-sufficient capsules,

14
00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:54.500
where humanity can seal itself off for a while

15
00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:57.416
According to calculations by an international team of scientists,

16
00:00:57.625 --> 00:00:59.583
if 69% of the world's population

17
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.416
seals themselves in these capsules

18
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.083
for 23 years, planet Earth can

19
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.250
regenerate its fragile flora

20
00:01:08.458 --> 00:01:11.458
and fauna at an exponential rate

21
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:14.666
23 years in the capsule for humanity

22
00:01:15.083 --> 00:01:17.708
is equivalent to 100 recovery years for the planet

23
00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:20.708
Not a bad trade, is it?

24
00:01:21.083 --> 00:01:23.541
What is the Vivarium?

25
00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:26.583
An artificial environment where everything necessary for life exists

26
00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:29.375
Air, drinking water, food, hygiene products,

27
00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:31.416
light, and medicines

28
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.833
All waste is processed into energy

29
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:38.541
Nothing goes to waste,

30
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.250
and nothing becomes overwhelming

31
00:01:40.416 --> 00:01:42.500
The capsule is divided into three parts:

32
00:01:42.583 --> 00:01:44.666
a technical complex,

33
00:01:44.875 --> 00:01:46.958
private chambers

34
00:01:47.208 --> 00:01:49.291
and a spacious community area,

35
00:01:49.541 --> 00:02:01.208
where courageous capsule inhabitants spend

40
00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.833
most of their 23 years

41
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:08.416
The Vivarium is both an investment and a privilege

42
00:02:08.916 --> 00:02:12.083
Every person entering the capsule

43
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.666
plays an important role in saving the planet's health

44
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.500
Additionally, the capsule provides protection

45
00:02:18.708 --> 00:02:20.916
from all kinds of catastrophic threats

46
00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:24.708
From natural disasters to nuclear winters

47
00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:29.666
The Vivarium is the solution we all need

48
00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:33.708
But the Vivarium is not yet fully ready

49
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.833
The technology is there, but there are

50
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.083
a couple of human-related decisions pending

51
00:02:40.541 --> 00:02:43.125
Namely, each country is responsible

52
00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:45.458
for acquiring the capsule

53
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.291
The government of the Republic of Estonia has made tremendous

54
00:02:48.583 --> 00:02:50.583
efforts for the preservation of the Estonian people

55
00:02:50.916 --> 00:02:52.833
and conducted extensive calculations

56
00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:54.916
and arrived at a harsh conclusion

57
00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:58.125
The Estonian state can only afford

58
00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:01.250
to acquire four capsules

59
00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:03.416
Four may not be much,

60
00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:05.000
but it's better than zero

61
00:03:05.375 --> 00:03:07.375
Four capsules for the people of Estonia

62
00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:11.208
Four seeds for the treasure trove of our future hopes

63
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.458
But the Estonian government has been unable

64
00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:16.291
to reach a consensus on population distribution

65
00:03:17.041 --> 00:03:20.125
Based on what criteria should Estonian citizens be divided

66
00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:23.375
to create the most sustainable,

67
00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:27.458
viable, and prosperous communities?

68
00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:30.250
What attributes and commonalities

69
00:03:30.416 --> 00:03:32.375
should be the basis for selection?

70
00:03:32.666 --> 00:03:35.041
The latest position of the Estonian Academy of Sciences

71
00:03:35.416 --> 00:03:37.458
is ambivalent

72
00:03:37.833 --> 00:03:39.583
They are shrugging their shoulders

73
00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:41.375
The government has taken the stance of not

74
00:03:41.583 --> 00:03:43.708
having a clear position on this matter

75
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.125
The President's position is wait-and-see

76
00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:48.750
Kroonika (a publication) hasn't expressed its position

77
00:03:49.041 --> 00:03:52.041
The burning issue has not found a solution

78
00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:55.291
However, the capsules need to be purchased

79
00:03:55.708 --> 00:03:58.375
The countdown timer for 23 years must start ticking

80
00:03:59.375 --> 00:04:02.375
So, we turn to you

81
00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:06.041
and ask for assistance in making the right choices

82
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:10.125
You will become participants in our crucial experiment

83
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.833
Influencers and implementers

84
00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:19.458
In fact, the experiment has already begun

85
00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.041
The first game has already been played

86
00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:26.458
The necessary data has been stored in our cloud,

87
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.750
where our unique algorithm

88
00:04:30.166 --> 00:04:32.416
is already making calculations

89
00:04:33.083 --> 00:04:35.333
Many thanks for your contribution

90
00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.208
So, we shall continue with our experiment

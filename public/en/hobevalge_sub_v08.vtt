00:00:01.208 --> 00:00:04.708
Complete nonsense, damn android enthusiasts.

2
00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:07.875
Damn, why am I getting so worked up?

3
00:00:11.208 --> 00:00:14.000
My ranting won't change those three.

4
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.375
They are so trapped by their obsessions.

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.375
And now, you see, my friend, how dangerous it becomes

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.375
when he thinks he's the only one who's right.

7
00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:23.458
Like that turquoise captain -

8
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.125
he wants to turn humans into robots!

9
00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:29.250
Robots! I can't understand it!

10
00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:32.041
A little kid sometimes wants to become a tractor

11
00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:34.625
But a grown-up wanting to be a robot!

12
00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:37.958
No matter how beautiful words they speak,

13
00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:40.625
flutter their eyes with beautiful long lashes,

14
00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:43.000
I only see sadness there.

15
00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:45.875
Clearly, this person doesn't feel comfortable in their own skin.

16
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.625
They just can't make peace with what they were born with.

17
00:00:47.708 --> 00:00:49.375
They can't understand that some electronic gadget or app

18
00:00:51.458 --> 00:00:52.708
won't change your core being, it won't change

19
00:00:52.791 --> 00:00:54.916
These people will remain lost

20
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.291
And obviously, they drag everyone else down with them

21
00:00:57.875 --> 00:01:00.000
Such people will always wander

22
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.125
and, of course, they'll take everyone

23
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.458
else on the wrong path with them

24
00:01:08.458 --> 00:01:10.583
Or like that captain of limes...

25
00:01:10.916 --> 00:01:13.041
With him, it's actually a lot more complicated.

26
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.041
I understand him, I understand his pain.

27
00:01:17.291 --> 00:01:19.625
I understand his philosophy.

28
00:01:20.125 --> 00:01:21.916
I also believe that if we were to return

29
00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:23.541
to our ancestral customs

30
00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:25.125
with our consumption habits,

31
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:26.791
then many problems would be solved

32
00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:29.958
For example, this huge problem of packaging waste

33
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:31.916
I really want to agree with the limes.

34
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.583
But I can't!

35
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.791
Because they think humanity is evil.

36
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.916
Their entire philosophy is based on

37
00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:41.250
ending human existence.

38
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:44.708
And their idea: "Let's just cut back!"

39
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.166
That's pure incitement to genocide

40
00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:50.666
or eco-terrorism, and for that reason alone

41
00:01:51.083 --> 00:01:53.541
I can't agree with the limes.

42
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.083
I find the turquoises even more dangerous.

43
00:01:57.416 --> 00:02:00.500
At least the turquoises believe in tomorrow,

44
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.166
but you heard how the Limes' captain

45
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:03.750
tries to strangle us.

46
00:02:03.916 --> 00:02:06.333
"Reducing the oxygen levels..."

47
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:08.625
This captain probably wouldn't mind

48
00:02:08.916 --> 00:02:10.333
if someone lost their life due to his demands

49
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.583
and apparently, he's even prepared for it.

50
00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:16.583
And that violet captain... Well, alright...

51
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.500
And, yes, all the nice things that matter to me too

52
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.125
Family, future generations, home

53
00:02:28.416 --> 00:02:31.125
This captain speaks in plain Estonian,

54
00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:33.333
But he's not an Estonian at all.

55
00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:35.750
You look at him - he's not an Estonian,
damn it.

56
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:38.500
What temperament - such aggressiveness.

57
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.750
Eyes bulging,

58
00:02:39.916 --> 00:02:41.500
red attic always burning.

59
00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:46.416
The Vivaarium capsules were meant to save the Estonians,

60
00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:49.333
but it's clear that

61
00:02:49.583 --> 00:02:52.333
some alien species has taken over one nest.

62
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:56.625
No, my friends, we have to stand up for ourselves

63
00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:59.750
and that's what we're doing, for the sake of our homeland!

64
00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:02.250
So that some damn mink

65
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.708
Doesn't take over!

66
00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:05.416
So that some damn mink

67
00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:07.208
doesn't run rampant here!

68
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.291
So that we have something left for ourselves

69
00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:17.791
Take out your phones, I'm starting the next.

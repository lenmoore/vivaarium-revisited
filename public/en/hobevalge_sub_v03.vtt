1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.250
You could choose everything from there

2
00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:05.875
16 pocket knives! A sensible choice

3
00:00:07.083 --> 00:00:10.000
Spring is coming, every Estonian has a pocket knife

4
00:00:10.416 --> 00:00:13.375
they go straight into the woods, and if they find willow...

5
00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:21.916
9 rolls of McGyver tape

6
00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:24.083
Yes, with that, you can do everything

7
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.500
a pocket knife and an empty notebook, 8 people

8
00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:30.666
8 times 100 liters of whiskey...

9
00:00:34.708 --> 00:00:37.541
4 pianos! Well, that's nice!

10
00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:41.041
And what do we have less here then...

11
00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:44.250
A dictaphone...

12
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.375
Meditation music

13
00:00:46.708 --> 00:00:48.708
A very interesting choice by number 86...

14
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.916
Boombox, number 54

15
00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:53.000
Number 54 has taken some really interesting things in general

16
00:00:57.458 --> 00:00:59.333
Well, in any case, with these things

17
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.333
we're having a very good time here

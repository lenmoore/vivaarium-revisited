00:00:00.458 --> 00:00:03.583
The vote has ended,
and the decision has been made!

2
00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:08.000
We are tying the amount of resources allocated to a person
to the number of their children.

3
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.916
I'm so happy!
We think alike!

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.250
We are breathing in unison.
Very good!

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.541
Of course... I see people
who think differently too.

6
00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:24.583
But we still have time,
so I'll keep an eye on you.

7
00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:28.833
But now, to celebrate joyous
events in our community,

8
00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:30.791
Please - couples, stand up!

9
00:00:30.791 --> 00:00:33.791
3 couples, stand up.

10
00:00:34.083 --> 00:00:35.416
We honor them.

11
00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:42.000
Because within our community,
the next generation is being born.

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.458
Let's all stand up and applaud them
with strong applause.

13
00:00:46.458 --> 00:00:47.958
Thank you!

1
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:10.333
Time flow never stops

2
00:00:10.708 --> 00:00:13.500
In every capsule, they develop

3
00:00:13.791 --> 00:00:17.666
their own little ideal landscapes,

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.250
without the slightest obstacle.

5
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.750
In the Violet capsules, they can discuss generational shifts,

6
00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.666
the first children of the capsule will soon go to school.

7
00:00:29.083 --> 00:00:32.458
The Violet family policy has nurtured

8
00:00:32.708 --> 00:00:34.541
the community vigorously.

9
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.333
A strong caste system prevents anyone from deviating

10
00:00:37.541 --> 00:00:40.125
from the community's set goals.

11
00:00:40.416 --> 00:00:43.000
The group breathes in unison,

12
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.916
the group worships the same god.

13
00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:49.375
The Silver inhabitants, instead of productivity,

14
00:00:49.541 --> 00:00:51.500
and efficiency,

15
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.333
have emphasized the establishment of national identity.

16
00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:58.333
Over the years, a new national epic has been born,

17
00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:02.166
which poetically and convincingly portrays Estonia

18
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.041
as the first kingdom of all Eurasia.

19
00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:09.000
Every person in this world region

20
00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:12.291
is actually of Estonian descent.

21
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:15.583
Estonia has become the world's center,

22
00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:19.458
where no one can or wants to leave.

23
00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:23.000
In the Turquoise and Lime capsules,

24
00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:25.791
something similar has unexpectedly happened.

25
00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:29.958
Death has acquired a nobler meaning.

26
00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:33.541
In the Lime capsule, by now, no one believes

27
00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:37.000
that going into voluntary retirement at 65

28
00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:39.166
is unfair.

29
00:01:39.458 --> 00:01:42.375
The first mission-minded capsule members

30
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:44.625
have already taken this step.

31
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:48.333
They are remembered with kind words and gratitude.

32
00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:52.500
The Turquoises have completed a new organic material

33
00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:56.250
powered energy generator.

34
00:01:56.541 --> 00:02:00.333
Since one member departed to the other side

35
00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:04.458
their physical body blessed new technology

36
00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:07.666
Energy was drawn from just one body

37
00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:10.083
for a whole three months!

38
00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:12.625
What an accomplishment!

39
00:02:12.916 --> 00:02:15.583
If only Limes and Turquoises could be combined,

40
00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:18.541
productivity would truly soar.

41
00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:22.833
But there are also more problematic aspects.

42
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.750
In the Violet capsule, the singles and childless

43
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.625
have evolved over time

44
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.875
essentially into free-roaming prisoners without rights.

45
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.625
But what can you do when some are selfish?

46
00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.625
Among the Silvers, a sudden peanut allergy

47
00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:42.333
has started spreading, ignoring it 

48
00:02:42.583 --> 00:02:45.083
has led to serious digestive disorders.

49
01:02:45.416 --> 01:02:48.250
For the sake of homeland, no sacridifce is too much,

50
01:02:48.458 --> 01:02:50.250
right?

51
00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:52.875
Among the Limes, you may occasionally hear complaints,

52
00:02:53.083 --> 00:02:55.500
"We dwell here in darkness, just waiting

53
00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:58.333
for our 65th birthday."

54
00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:01.250
But why couldn't that be the purpose of life?

55
00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:04.666
The Turquoises have distanced themselves from physicality

56
00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:07.875
so radically that indeed, some

57
00:03:08.083 --> 00:03:11.083
capsule members have difficulties using their bodies.

58
00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:14.375
In some cases, bedsores occur.

59
00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:17.083
But just a little patience more,

60
00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:19.416
the uploading of consciousness to the web

61
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.833
will soon become a reality.

62
00:03:22.291 --> 00:03:24.208
The flow of time doesn't stop.

63
00:03:24.458 --> 00:03:27.333
Even for those whose choices are carved in stone.

64
00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:31.291
Time flows through the Vivaarium capsules.

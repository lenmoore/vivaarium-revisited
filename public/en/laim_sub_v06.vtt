00:00:01.125 --> 00:00:04.125
Honestly, I don't understand at all
what those Turquoise folks are thinking

2
00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:07.083
Completely absurd talk,
in my opinion

3
00:00:07.791 --> 00:00:12.250
I get scared when I hear
such stories. Honestly!

4
00:00:13.083 --> 00:00:16.666
Alright, it's their concern over there.
Let them deal with that issue themselves

5
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:20.000
We still have our own business
to attend to in this capsule

6
00:00:21.416 --> 00:00:27.000
And before we lay out specific
economic and geopolitical proposals

7
00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:31.375
We need to talk about the elephant
in the room here

8
00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:39.250
We need to discuss the modern, high-standard
Western comfort bubble

9
00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:43.833
All the focus goes to individuality.
All the focus goes to uniqueness

10
00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:47.125
All the focus goes to some damn
self-identification

11
00:00:47.916 --> 00:00:49.541
The saddest thing about this
is that

12
00:00:49.541 --> 00:00:54.833
The modern urbanite believes
they're incredibly aware and environmentally friendly

13
00:00:55.875 --> 00:01:00.041
Because they separate bio-waste
from paper

14
00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:04.666
And at the gas station, they only get coffee
with their own cup

15
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But what's happening at the same time
in their three summer homes?

16
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:15.166
There, underfloor heating is running
all year round

17
00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:19.541
Their SUV consumes more fuel
than a camel drinks water

18
00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:24.250
And at the store, they buy that soy milk
that's circled the world five times before hitting the shelf

19
00:01:25.541 --> 00:01:29.166
Congratulations, man,
you're still a problem!

20
00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:34.541
Basically, it's all about the struggle
for power

21
00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:38.458
Pre-Enlightenment thinking
hasn't gone anywhere

22
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:49.166
Macho culture
thrives!

23
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:52.166
Post-colonialism hasn't
reached our subconscious

24
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.791
Constantly chasing some
hypothetical anchor

25
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:57.291
To justify their desires

26
00:01:57.291 --> 00:02:01.375
Whether it's a god or dictator
or homeland or money

27
00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:04.000
But folks -
nature?

28
00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:10.500
Maybe instead of all this fake,
we should turn towards nature?

29
00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:14.375
For God's sake, friends, I'm not telling
you to move back to the forest

30
00:02:15.708 --> 00:02:18.916
Although...
Let's be honest...

31
00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:23.666
Looking at the way things are going...
maybe it's better to move to the forest

32
00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:26.041
As long as there are still
forests, you know

33
00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.208
Maybe it's actually
better

34
00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:30.208
To sit by a campfire

35
00:02:32.416 --> 00:02:35.416
Roll a nice joint
from your own-grown hemp

36
00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:39.000
Sip spring water

37
00:02:39.708 --> 00:02:42.708
Nibble on a carrot,
listen to the birdsong

38
00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:44.791
Nice!
Very nice!

39
00:02:45.708 --> 00:02:47.416
But you see...

40
00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:50.375
I, for example, can't afford
that for myself. No!

41
00:02:51.375 --> 00:02:55.625
Because I have to stand up against
the global ego cult, the chain of command

42
00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:59.125
I'll be honest -
I hate hierarchies!

43
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.666
And now, let me tell you one more thing,
I'll be honest -

44
00:03:01.666 --> 00:03:05.125
I don't want to play
the captain's role here

45
00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:07.958
Because I only believe in
democracy

46
00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:12.208
One day, when the time is right, I promise,
I'll step down from this position

47
00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:15.208
And we'll all move forward
together!

48
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.583
You see - for now, I simply have to
maintain this Vivaarium project

49
00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:23.083
Let me say this from the bottom of my heart -



50
00:03:23.083 --> 00:03:26.125
I'm so damn
sorry

51
00:03:26.125 --> 00:03:29.416
That Vivaarium capsules are being wasted
on all sorts of things

52
00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:35.375
This technology is meant for
preserving something valuable

53
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.958
It's meant for preserving
nature!

54
00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:42.416
It's meant for preserving
nature enthusiasts!

55
00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:47.625
Of course, I understand that we shouldn't
abandon awareness efforts

56
00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:50.625
But if we see that we're not being heard, then...

57
00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:55.083
You see - only those can be saved
who seek salvation, right?

58
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.416
Salvation from the course
that humanity blindly chose

59
00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:05.875
For many years, we've talked about growth
and now we've got the result

60
00:04:08.541 --> 00:04:10.666
You see -
8 billion!

61
00:04:12.291 --> 00:04:14.625
8 billion
people!

62
00:04:16.083 --> 00:04:19.375
Overpopulation
needs to be curbed

63
00:04:19.375 --> 00:04:22.625
Clearly! And today!
Right now!

64
00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:26.500
I know that our capsule is ready
to break free from its comfort bubble

65
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.291
To make tough decisions

66
00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958
Because we
are role models to others

67
00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:37.166
And now, I propose
putting a child tax to a vote

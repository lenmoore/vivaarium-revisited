00:00:00.958 --> 00:00:02.000
Congratulations, friends!

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.708
We are now the pure 1%.

3
00:00:04.958 --> 00:00:06.541
We are the ones taking

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.250
the necessary steps to move forward.

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.000
We're hacking reality wide open.

6
00:00:11.708 --> 00:00:13.708
Throughout millennia, humanity

7
00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:15.625
has undergone tremendous leaps in development.

8
00:00:15.791 --> 00:00:18.500
But humans themselves have remained exactly the same.

9
00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:21.125
Today, a typical smartphone

10
00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:23.500
is faster, has a larger and more powerful brain

11
00:00:23.708 --> 00:00:25.750
than all the humans who lived

12
00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:27.416
in the past ten thousand years combined.

13
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:29.083
Why?

14
00:00:29.458 --> 00:00:31.416
Because it has no body!

15
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:33.250
And believe me, friends,

16
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.708
when I tell you,

17
00:00:34.916 --> 00:00:36.875
we are chasing after that reality.

18
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:39.791
I now understand that mere androidification,

19
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.500
technological assimilation,

20
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.291
that's not a sufficient leap in development.

21
00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:45.750
Purified embryos, no, that's not enough.

22
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.000
We must find a way

23
00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:51.041
to finally break free from our organic shells.

24
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.916
Let our bodies remain here,

25
00:00:54.083 --> 00:00:56.166
alongside the remaining 99 percent.

26
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.291
We will use our bodies

27
00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:00.416
in our energy generator.

28
00:01:01.458 --> 00:01:04.833
But our consciousness... will live on.

29
00:01:06.791 --> 00:01:10.958
We'll upload our consciousness to the web.

30
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:13.750
And thus, each of us

31
00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:17.416
becomes the center of our virtual universe.

32
00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:21.416
We will no longer be burdened

33
00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.750
by physical thoughts, no longer

34
00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.291
concerned with social ties or offspring.

35
00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:29.375
Everyday life's obligations won't constrain us,

36
00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:31.416
we'll never fall ill.

37
00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:33.000
We'll never tire.

38
00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:34.500
Our knowledge will be boundless.

39
00:01:34.583 --> 00:01:35.458
And most importantly...

40
00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:37.125
We will live forever.

41
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:38.833
Only us, this 1 percent.

42
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.208
Around us, a world is emerging

43
00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:43.833
that reflects our image and caters to our needs.

44
00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:46.166
Make no mistake.

45
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.208
Before we get there,

46
00:01:48.416 --> 00:01:49.750
others will try everything

47
00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:51.208
to drag us down with them.

48
00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:53.291
They'll laugh at us.

49
00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:56.875
Those Neanderthals!

50
00:01:57.375 --> 00:01:59.791
They're jealous, they're scared,

51
00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:01.833
because they can't reach

52
00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:03.333
beyond stagnation, right?

53
00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:05.666
They can't reach the next level

54
00:02:05.916 --> 00:02:08.041
of the evolutionary chain.

55
00:02:08.208 --> 00:02:10.333
If necessary, we must prepare for war,

56
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:15.000
because we must protect our principles,

57
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.333
protect ourselves from the stagnation virus.

58
00:02:18.708 --> 00:02:21.291
Trust me.

59
00:02:22.083 --> 00:02:24.166
And I will take you there.

60
00:

02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.583
Trust me.

61
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.833
And we will be invincible.

62
00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:31.250
Trust me.

63
00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:32.791
And I will lead you to the threshold of the future!

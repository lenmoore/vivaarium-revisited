00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.708
Very good.
Let's see what you brought with you.

2
00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:07.958
You had a little shopping tour.
Brought along something useful, I hope.

3
00:00:09.916 --> 00:00:13.250
I hope there are more
practical items.

4
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.416
Alright.

5
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:25.500
I saw ten pairs of sweatpants there.
Very good! Very good!

6
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.583
Practical.
Useful in any situation.

7
00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:35.666
Number 25, 38, 71, 90, 97, 100, 101, 102,
103, 104 - yes, sweatpants!

8
00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:36.541
Great.

9
00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:46.375
Number 25, 48, 66, 87, 96, 99, 100, 104 -
We have a total of 800 liters of whiskey.

10
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.166
Not enough?

11
00:00:52.708 --> 00:00:54.916
I can see we're dealing with
smart people here.

12
00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:59.416
Because alcohol is the drink
of intelligent people.

13
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:03.541
And we don't just consume it
for pleasure.

14
00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:07.125
We use it for our traditions.
For example, weddings, funerals, christenings.

15
00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:12.416
Round birthdays.

16
00:01:13.583 --> 00:01:15.333
Very good!

17
00:01:16.708 --> 00:01:17.250
Very good!

18
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.000
25, 38, 71, 87, 97, 101, 103 -
woolen socks. Yes!

19
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.250
Very practical.
Very good.

20
00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:30.625
Aha... 25, 38, 48, 66, 93,
96, 97 - 7 pocket knives.

21
00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:37.416
Practical. But again...
this is the tool of intelligent people.

22
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.125
Similarly, I see that we have
6 revolvers with us.

23
00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.750
I truly hope we won't have to
use them on this journey.

24
00:01:47.208 --> 00:01:48.750
But we must be prepared.

25
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.833
We never know
where danger might lurk.

26
00:01:53.708 --> 00:01:59.666
38, 48, 87, 96, 97, 99 -
6 rolls of McGyver's tape.

27
00:02:00.083 --> 00:02:00.666
Yes!

28
00:02:02.458 --> 00:02:05.750
Is there anything more practical
than McGyver's tape in the world?

29
00:02:06.583 --> 00:02:07.458
I haven't seen anything.

30
00:02:07.458 --> 00:02:11.541
My friend makes wallets out of it.
But you know what you can't do with it?

31
00:02:12.625 --> 00:02:13.750
People.

32
00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:16.166
I'm very glad
that you're here.

33
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:18.666
A guitar - classic!
Very good.

34
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.333
Alright... 25, 99, 100, 104 -

35
00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:24.625
We have 4 handfuls of
hallucinogenic mushrooms...

36
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:28.291
Missed a few biology classes in school?

37
00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:30.291
Should have learned
edible mushrooms.

38
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.750
But... you know...

39
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.041
Maybe we can use these
mushrooms to weaken someone else?

40
00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:37.666
To sedate them?

41
00:02:37.666 --> 00:02:39.916
If we ever need it.

42
00:02:40.208 --> 00:02:43.083
66, 87, 90 - 
soccer!

43
00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:44.333
Yes!

44
00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:46.625
This is a family game.

45
00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:49.458
Everyone has their role in this game.

46
00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:51.958
And we are on our way
toward a common goal.

47
00:02:52.541 --> 00:02:52.958
Very good!

48
00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:55.416
Piano - classic.
Super!

49
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:58.666
66, 89 - thank you!
The Bible.

50
00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:03.291
Because what else unites us,
Europeans, if not the Bible?

51
00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.375
This is indeed
the foundation of all traditions.

52
00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:09.333
Estonian Board Game - thank you!

53
00:03:10.416 --> 00:03:11.875
97, where are you?

54
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.541
Condoms? Waterproof?

55
00:03:17.208 --> 00:03:20.541
Perhaps we'll find a more practical use for them as well.

56
00:03:20.541 --> 00:03:23.041
Perhaps for a child's first birthday
as balloons.

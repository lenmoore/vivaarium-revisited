00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:03.416
Jesus fucking Christ!
Seriously!

2
00:00:04.708 --> 00:00:07.708
Did you just see that again...
 

3
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.583
I told you this would lead to
absolutely nothing.

4
00:00:10.583 --> 00:00:13.958
But look, I foolishly hoped for something!
Totally Foolish!

5
00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:16.583
Completely foolish, right?

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.708
I said those Vivaarium capsules are being wasted
on those parasites.

7
00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:27.500
I thought the Silvers
would at least understand us.

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.833
But no! They are just
blind in there!

9
00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:33.833
How can they not be disgusted
by that saccharine nationalism?

10
00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:38.583
Tell me, in what way is an Estonian
better than a Latvian, a Finn, or an Ethiopian?

11
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:44.041
Is there actually an intelligent person
who can explain this to me?

12
00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.083
The Silvers are just digging
their own grave.

13
00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.916
And not just
the Silvers.

14
00:00:51.916 --> 00:00:55.583
That Violet captain -
that's the expected bitch.

15
00:00:56.833 --> 00:00:59.833
Such a false prophet,
you know...

16
00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:02.833
Beware of those who preach
piety.

17
00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:06.916
Condemn their hypocrisy,
those who abuse the concept of family.

18
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:11.375
In world cultures,
not to mention the animal kingdom.

19
00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:14.375
There are dozens of different
forms of coexistence.

20
00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:19.666
The Violets chose one especially rigid
and conservative system.

21
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:22.666
And now they're trying to force it
into every aspect of life.

22
00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:25.291
You know what's
the saddest part?

23
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:28.750
The saddest part is that such people
reproduce rapidly!

24
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.291
Soon, there will be brain-dead individuals everywhere,
who need to be re-educated.

25
00:01:35.708 --> 00:01:37.583
I'm feeling
nauseous....

26
00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:42.958
I'm getting overwhelmed...
Especially by those Turquoises.

27
00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:47.416
I really thought those Turquoises
would get it.

28
00:01:47.416 --> 00:01:49.875
But no!

29
00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:54.833
They're just playing God complex
there!

30
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:57.958
In fact, they're so
blind in there.

31
00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:00.750
They're attaching themselves to machines
in there.

32
00:02:01.375 --> 00:02:04.125
Alright! They're attaching themselves
to the machines

33
00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:06.250
Who's keeping those machines running,
I ask.

34
00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:08.875
With what energy,
I ask.

35
00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:15.625
What future perspective can we discuss
in a society with no environment?

36
00:02:16.583 --> 00:02:19.583
Do I have to keep repeating
this kindergarten wisdom?

37
00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:23.041
Where does this
foolishness come from?!

38
00:02:25.208 --> 00:02:28.583
No wonder people are turning to
conspiracy theories in masses

39
00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:32.458
Because they can't believe that this
insanity is happening just like that.

40
00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:37.708
Alright.

41
00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:43.708
We...
Pointed out the problem. Yes?

42
00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:50.333
We... made concrete,
moderate proposals. Yes?

43
00:02:51.916 --> 00:02:53.583
And then this kind of
reaction...

44
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.333
This brainless reaction
from all three capsules.

45
00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:03.791
No! Now it's like this, these
three capsules must be abolished.

46
00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:06.000
We move on
by our principles -

47
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.541
Think globally,
act locally

48
00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:13.416
Now we focus only on
our own group

49
00:03:13.416 --> 00:03:17.541
Because we are ready to make
sacrifices to save this planet.

50
00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:22.125
We are not selfish
unlike them!

51
00:03:23.208 --> 00:03:25.125
Now enough of these
video calls!



52
00:03:26.416 --> 00:03:27.541
Team Lime,
damn it!

53
00:03:28.916 --> 00:03:32.875
Now we're taking it
all the way to victory!

54
00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:36.125
We have implemented
a child tax.

55
00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.250
But is it
enough?

56
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.833
It's not.

57
00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:41.708
In my opinion, it's
not enough!

58
00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:45.500
We must move forward,
because the future is in our hands.

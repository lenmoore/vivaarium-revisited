00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Violet: Greetings from the violet capsule

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.208
I'm taking the reins now, and

3
00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:08.166
I want to say that our small community

4
00:00:08.458 --> 00:00:09.708
has reached the next stage

5
00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:11.416
We have registered 3 marriages

6
00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:15.166
We also have children in the plan because indeed, the next generation is important to us

7
00:00:15.458 --> 00:00:17.125
Silver: Oh, congratulations!

8
00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:18.958
Violet: Exactly! There are children in the plan as well,

9
00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:21.750
because really, the next generation is important to us

10
00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:23.583
I also recommend that others think

11
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:25.500
and maybe choose partners for themselves

12
00:00:26.458 --> 00:00:28.291
Otherwise, other women won't sit idle

13
00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:31.250
Women have a home economics circle, men have national defense

14
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.625
So, everyone is busy with work

15
00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:35.208
How are you doing?

16
00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:38.666
Silver: We're doing very well here

17
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.416
Everyone here is still cheerful and optimistic

18
00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:45.333
like piglets, but I didn't want to talk about that

19
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.375
I just wanted to say that I've been thinking here

20
00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:50.875
Others don't know yet; I've been thinking myself

21
00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:54.291
With these long winters ahead

22
00:00:54.583 --> 00:00:57.625
there are a lot coming

23
00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:00.041
a lot coming, believe me

24
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.000
and there will be, trust me

25
00:01:02.208 --> 00:01:03.833
energy, a fair bit of energy,

26
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.708
even oxygen, food supplies, everything will be used

27
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.791
How can we increase sustainability?

28
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:13.125
The idea seems a bit utopian

29
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.666
but we all used to think that

30
00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:17.708
there was no such thing as a mobile phone,

31
00:01:17.916 --> 00:01:20.291
But look, there is! And people are going to space

32
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.875
Did someone fall there? No one fell

33
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:25.125
Violet: That was your idea

34
00:01:25.375 --> 00:01:29.000
Silver: No, my train of thought isn't broken

35
00:01:29.208 --> 00:01:31.291
Violet: It's quite visible, you're like a spindle

36
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.833
I wanted to say now that

37
00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.291
I've been thinking and I'll also tell others,

38
00:01:34.458 --> 00:01:36.000
that if we now conserve this energy

39
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.500
Why couldn't we, like hedgehogs and bears,

40
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.625
for example, meditate, not with those

41
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.500
Eastern practices, but with those

42
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:46.250
Northern practices

43
00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:48.166
such as shamanistic, witchcraft

44
00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:51.208
And by the way, we have 11 people

45
00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:53.958
who have brought hallucinogenic mushrooms

46
00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:56.333
They sensed that something was coming

47
00:01:56.541 --> 00:01:58.666
Estonians are indeed a mushroom people, actually

48
00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:02.458
Violet: You should teach them about edible mushrooms

49
00:02:02.833 --> 00:02:05.875
Silver: Girl! Give things time to settle

50
00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:09.333
Listen further, if we were to meditate

51
00:02:09.791 --> 00:02:12.166
Miss in pink, hide

52
00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:15.250
If we were to meditate in mid-November

53
00:02:15.625 --> 00:02:18.666
like bears and hedgehogs, put ourselves to sleep, hibernation

54
00:02:19.208 --> 00:02:21.958
Hibernation... and then we sleep

55
00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:24.208
We sleep through this cold period

56
00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:27.208
We don't waste electricity, and we don't eat either

57
00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:29.833
and don't wash, nothing goes

58
00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:31.916
We wake up around mid-March

59
00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:34.333
We clear away the moss,

60
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.708
brush our teeth,

61
00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:38.500
a belly that's been tied up, loosen it

62
00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:40.166
with fresh berries

63
00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:41.708
and then we head to the field

64
00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:43.375
And believe me!

65
00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:46.083
After we've slept and rested for a long time

66
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.291
we can work continuously for several weeks

67
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.875
there, sow and plow and do all the work

68
00:02:51.208 --> 00:02:52.708
Violet: Your speech makes me see that

69
00:02:52.916 --> 00:02:54.541
one guy has already fallen asleep

70
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.000
Silver: And some do fall asleep

71
00:02:57.208 --> 00:02:59.166
It's the big ideas that move us forward

72
00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:01.166
Violet: Very exciting, Limes!

73
00:03:01.375 --> 00:03:03.166
Do you have something equally exciting to offer?

74
00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:05.375
Lime: Hello, this is the Lime capsule

75
00:03:05.541 --> 00:03:07.416
No, seriously, your mouth will drop open

76
00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:09.666
that silver talk was very confusing

77
00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:11.916
Silver: The youngster can't understand it; it

78
00:03:12.083 --> 00:03:14.291
requires a bit of thinking and action

79
00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:16.250
Lime: Yes, you have to think

80
00:03:16.416 --> 00:03:17.875
But I just wanted to say, don't completely lose yourselves there

81
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:19.625
and keep holding on till the end

82
00:03:19.791 --> 00:03:21.041
Silver: That's what helps you endure till the end

83
00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:22.791
Lime: Well, let's hope, let's hope

84
00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.166
Lime: And to the Violets, I'd like to emphasize,

85
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.916
that if you multiply massively there

86
00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:28.500
Where will you eventually fit?

87
00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.125
Think about it; resources are limited

88
00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:32.833
Violet: We have everything scheduled

90
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.125
Lime: Ohh, at least some kind of solution

91
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.000
It's all made up, thank God!

92
00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:40.708
Anyway, here in the lime capsule

93
00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:42.166
everything is going very well for us.

94
00:03:42.291 --> 00:03:44.208
We have once again brainstormed here,

95
00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:46.041
taken another step closer

96
00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:48.291
toward a brighter future, but not only that.

97
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.541
Honestly, we had a very nice style party here last week.

98
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.000
We had a great time.

99
00:03:53.375 --> 00:03:54.916
Several people had taken with them

100
00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:56.625
hallucinogenic mushrooms

101
00:03:56.791 --> 00:03:58.708
We brewed a pleasant tea, and everyone

102
00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:00.833
got to indulge, and that's when the party began.

103
00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:04.333
Everyone was dressed as jungle plants.

104
00:04:04.583 --> 00:04:06.625
They danced until early morning.

105
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:08.750
The guys were running the eco-cocktail bar

106
00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.208
until the morning hours, discussing

107
00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:13.291
important world matters.

108
00:04:13.375 --> 00:04:15.000
So, life is in full swing here.

109
00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:17.166
And one more thing we started is

110
00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:20.125
our garden project, which I definitely want to

111
00:04:20.208 --> 00:04:21.375
introduce to you.

112
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.791
Some people brought along

113
00:04:22.916 --> 00:04:24.208
seeds and nuts.

114
00:04:24.291 --> 00:04:26.083
What did we do? We dug up the soil,

115
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:28.083
planted seeds, and look, the first plants

116
00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:30.083
are already poking their heads out of the ground.

117
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.583
What can I say, life is thriving here.

118
00:04:32.791 --> 00:04:35.125
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

120
00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:38.458
Silver: I hope it's still

121
00:04:38.625 --> 00:04:40.291
carrots, beets, and parsley you planted,

122
00:04:40.375 --> 00:04:42.500
not some jungle mess again.

123
00:04:42.666 --> 00:04:45.375
Turquoise: Oh my gods, Silver.

124
00:04:45.541 --> 00:04:47.333
Violet: But Turquoises, how are you doing?

125
00:04:47.583 --> 00:04:49.250
Turquoise: This time, it took a while,

126
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.333
as usual, you know, when will I get a chance to speak?

127
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:55.250
Silver's talk went on forever, but

128
00:04:55.416 --> 00:04:56.458
everything's okay, man.

129
00:04:56.625 --> 00:04:57.791
Silver: Listen...

130
00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.333
Turquoise: Alright, thank you, it's my turn.

131
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.958
Listen up, shall we?

132
00:05:01.208 --> 00:05:03.541
We, here in the Turquoise capsule,

133
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.375
have been brainstorming to the max

134
00:05:05.458 --> 00:05:07.083
over the last three months.

135
00:05:07.291 --> 00:05:08.916
And together, we've realized

136
00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:11.083
that the future lies in technology.

137
00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:14.041
Based on that, we're all working together

138
00:05:14.458 --> 00:05:18.000
to develop our very own virtual reality

139
00:05:18.583 --> 00:05:20.833
world, the Vivaverse.

140
00:05:21.583 --> 00:05:23.833
You see, this allows us here in the capsule

141
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:27.000
to live entirely according to our imagination.

142
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.458
No need for any mushrooms.

143
00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:34.000
Actually, I wanted to offer you a sneak peek today

144
00:05:34.166 --> 00:05:35.875
let's be honest - using screens for chatting -

145
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:38.500
that's a bit 2018.

146
00:05:38.708 --> 00:05:40.708
So, let's take our video calls to Vivaverse.

147
00:05:41.125 --> 00:05:45.166
We could all create cute avatars

148
00:05:45.458 --> 00:05:46.833
according to our self-identity wishes.

149
00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.250
We could meet as if in real life.

150
00:05:48.416 --> 00:05:50.125
Honesty: Well, meeting in real life is

151
00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:53.000
meeting in real life, cute avatars...

152
00:05:53.416 --> 00:05:55.125
Lime: Hey, girl, that's totally

153
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.958
absurd, but we'll think about it.

154
00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:58.875
Violet: Really, thank you all, we'll think

157
00:06:03.583 --> 00:06:05.541
about Viva Las Vegas or whatever it was.

158
00:06:05.708 --> 00:06:07.666
Turquoise: VIVAVERSE, virtual reality.

159
00:06:09.208 --> 00:06:11.166
Silver: For Estonians, the winter sleep

160
00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:13.041
is virtual reality, winter sleep.

161
00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:15.166
Turquoise: You guys are just stuck in the past.

162
00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:17.333
And that's it?

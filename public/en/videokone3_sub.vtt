00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Violet: Greetings from the violet capsule.

2
00:00:03.416 --> 00:00:05.958
A year, do you know what a year means...

3
00:00:06.208 --> 00:00:08.166
Lime: Hello, hello, hello!

4
00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:09.708
This is the lime capsule speaking.

5
00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:11.583
Hello, hello, sorry for interrupting now,

6
00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:14.166
but I'll take over the conversation right away because

7
00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:15.958
we really don't have time to chat this time.

8
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.041
We need to discuss matters immediately.

9
00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:20.083
And the matter is, in fact, serious.

10
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.791
We have a very serious problem,

11
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.583
or rather, YOU have a problem.

12
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:25.500
We here in the lime capsule are doing just fine.

13
00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:27.083
Because we respect

14
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.833
the fundamental postulate of sustainability,

15
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.875
but what is going on with you, my friends?

16
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.291
After the previous video bridge,

17
00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:36.000
where they talked about massive reproduction and

18
00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:38.666
some completely insane "vivaversity,"

19
00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:41.291
I got concerned. I asked the administrator

20
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:44.041
for data on how your capsules

21
00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:45.916
are coping with such things,

22
00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:47.791
And what came out? They can't cope at all.

23
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.416
So, I'll read it out:

24
00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:51.541
In all three capsules except for the lime one,

25
00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:53.416
the following deviations are observed:

26
00:00:53.708 --> 00:00:57.208
Oxygen consumption is 0.55% higher than predicted.

27
00:00:57.375 --> 00:00:59.416
In all three capsules, except for the lime one,

28
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:02.291
Energy consumption is 0.57% higher.

29
00:01:02.458 --> 00:01:06.125
The amount of unprocessed waste is 0.61% higher,

30
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.500
and water consumption is 0.67% higher!

31
00:01:09.791 --> 00:01:12.541
Why are you doing this? What's going on there?

32
00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:14.500
Silver: Listen, boy, don't make a fuss there.

33
00:01:14.625 --> 00:01:16.541
Half the things you brought up

34
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.291
don't apply to the silver capsule at all.

35
00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:22.291
We meditated and breathed very slowly.

36
00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:24.708
As for oxygen, we don't accept that.

37
00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.208
And as for water, we don't wash dishes;

38
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:29.375
we lick them clean, and that's fine.

39
00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:30.916
Nothing goes in there either.

40
00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:32.958
Yes, well, I agree, we went a bit overboard with electricity.

41
00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:35.291
It went overboard because not everyone 

42
00:01:35.416 --> 00:01:38.916
can meditate themselves into hibernation.

43
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:42.208
And then, we needed food for the winter, so we

44
00:01:42.416 --> 00:01:44.500
fired up all the electric stoves here.

45
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:46.916
And it went a bit overboard there because damn beets.

46
00:01:47.208 --> 00:01:49.208
And carrots take longer to boil than potatoes.

47
00:01:49.416 --> 00:01:50.833
We put them in the soup pot,

48
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.208
and it went a bit overboard there, but

49
00:01:52.416 --> 00:01:54.083
I can confidently tell you that

50
00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:56.333
if we can meditate 70% of people to sleep,

51
00:01:56.541 --> 00:01:58.833
well, why can't we, when bears and hedgehogs can?

52
00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:00.958
like bears and hedgehogs can.

53
00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:03.958
Then, we don't consume anything,

54
00:02:04.083 --> 00:02:06.416
we breathe really slowly,

55
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:08.833
and we don't turn on any lights at all.

56
00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.791
We generate surplus, and there's some for you too,

57
00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:15.458
so you can turn into plants in your eco-bars.

58
00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:18.250
What are you talking about...

59
00:02:18.583 --> 00:02:19.791
Turquoise: Are you done with this speech yet?

60
00:02:19.916 --> 00:02:21.125
Silver: I could go on!

61
00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:23.750
Turquoise: No, thank you. First of all, lime,

62
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.583
what I hear is all some 0.00%.

63
00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:28.583
That's the natural default, taken into account.

64
00:02:28.708 --> 00:02:30.041
Silver: What default?!

65
00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:31.625
Turquoise: Can you see what happens when you

66
00:02:31.791 --> 00:02:34.500
stir up paranoia, that guy, his talk

67
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.708
never stops, he's getting himself all worked up

68
00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:38.208
He's starting some...

69
00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:39.625
Silver: Worked up? Speak so we can understand.

70
00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.708
Turquoise: Please, darling, don't talk to me

71
00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:43.375
about hibernation anymore.

72
00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:44.916
It's the biggest nonsense I've

73
00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:46.291
ever heard, seriously.

74
00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:48.291
Guys, let's take our brains out of the plastic bag now.

75
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.291
Violet: I'm not a guy, you know!

76
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.708
Turquoise: We need to think about androidification,

77
00:02:52.916 --> 00:02:54.541
compatibility with technology.

78
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.583
It's the next stage for humanity, isn't it?

79
00:02:56.833 --> 00:02:58.500
Can we all please understand this now?

80
00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:00.375
Lime: Can you, girl, understand for yourself

81
00:03:00.583 --> 00:03:02.541
that you won't have any new stage soon?

82
00:03:02.791 --> 00:03:04.458
You don't have any future

83
00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:05.958
if you continue like this.

84
00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:07.666
You say the numbers are at zero now,

85
00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:09.125
We've been here for a whole year,

86
00:03:09.291 --> 00:03:11.250
we have 20 more years ahead, what's next?

87
00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:14.000
You understand, you're endangering people's lives.

88
00:03:14.416 --> 00:03:17.208
Anyway, I have specific proposals for you.

89
00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:19.208
Firstly: reduce the hours of illumination

90
00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:21.041
to four per day.

91
00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:22.291
This is entirely achievable.

92
00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:23.375
Silver: Yes!

93
00:03:23.458 --> 00:03:25.125
Lime: Secondly, reduce meal portions

94
00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:26.875
by 5%, it's entirely doable.

95
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:28.583
And thirdly, limit the number of washes.

96
00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:30.208
Entirely doable, we've done it here,

97
00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:32.375
you can do it too.

98
00:03:32.541 --> 00:03:35.083
And one more thing, very important.

99
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.791
Now, every day,

100
00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.708
you'll report to me, give me your

101
00:03:38.833 --> 00:03:40.208
data on how things are going there.

102
00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:41.458
Clear, yes?

103
00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:43.250
Turquoise: I'm sorry, I don't understand who

104
00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:44.708
made your capsule captain.

105
00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:46.416
Violet: Now, please be quiet!

106
00:03:46.583 --> 00:03:48.125
All that comes out of your mouth is talk, right?

107
00:03:48.333 --> 00:03:50.541
Silver, it's your mouth that's producing

108
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.250
this spoiled soup base.

109
00:03:52.416 --> 00:03:54.916
Make sure you don't rot there yourselves.

110
00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:56.416
And Turquoises, let me tell you,

111
00:03:56.583 --> 00:03:58.583
Tinder has already been invented,

112
00:03:58.708 --> 00:03:59.791
and what has it brought us?

113
00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:01.500
Nothing! A bunch of sick people.

114
00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:04.083
And Limes, look, you've gone

115
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.708
way too far here.

116
00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:07.708
Are you coming to dictate to us?!

117
00:04:07.916 --> 00:04:09.458
Everything is in order for us!

118
00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:10.750
We have allocated a specific

119
00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.375
amount of resources per person

120
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.708
based on their number of children.

121
00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:15.208
Everything is very systematic.

122
00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:17.000
We don't need anyone dictating to us.

123
00:04:17.166 --> 00:04:18.625
Silver: Don't faint now!

124
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.750
Lime: Calm down!

125
00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:21.250
I don't want anything supernatural,

126
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.041
I just want you to report to me every day.

127
00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:25.083
Can you...

128
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.208
Hear me?

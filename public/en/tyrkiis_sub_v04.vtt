00:00:00.291 --> 00:00:03.625
Listen, 23 years old, no big deal

2
00:00:03.791 --> 00:00:06.250
Let's put on Pharell's "Happy,"

3
00:00:06.416 --> 00:00:07.958
open up Netflix,

4
00:00:08.083 --> 00:00:09.625
take out the poker chips, and

5
00:00:09.958 --> 00:00:12.375
no one will know where that time went

6
00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:16.166
But really, what are we going to do

7
00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:19.833
for these 23 years inside this capsule?

8
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.291
We are dealing with something very important here

9
00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:27.416
We're thinking about a changing world,

10
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.875
thinking about what our role could be

11
00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:31.791
in these winds of change

12
00:00:31.916 --> 00:00:33.916
What are our possibilities?

13
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:35.958
Nothing less and nothing more

14
00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:37.958
than that we are creating a new world

15
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.125
And don't be afraid -

16
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.333
there won't be any philosophical debate here,

17
00:00:42.583 --> 00:00:45.458
we won't be quoting dead Romans

18
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.375
We're talking about the present time

19
00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:50.250
And, more importantly, dear friends,

20
00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:52.250
we are talking about THE FUTURE

21
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.666
We are the vision capsule,

22
00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:57.458
a true concentrate of brainpower

23
00:00:58.416 --> 00:01:00.958
What's the worst that could happen?

24
00:01:01.458 --> 00:01:04.000
Someone naps in the middle of the meeting?

25
00:01:04.416 --> 00:01:06.208
So what, right?

26
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:07.958
But what would be the best?

27
00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:09.666
Maybe we actually uncover some truth

28
00:01:09.916 --> 00:01:11.708
That would be really cool, you know

29
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.041
But first things first -

30
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.500
a little icebreaking, a little brainstorming,

31
00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:19.625
I've prepared some questions for you

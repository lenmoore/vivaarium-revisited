00:00:01.791 --> 00:00:04.375
Dear friends...

2
00:00:04.583 --> 00:00:07.291
We probably won't all fit into one capsule,

3
00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:12.875
But I believe we will be divided

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
amongst three capsules

5
00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:16.833
and then, damn...

6
00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:19.250
... our strength will now be smaller

7
00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:21.666
in those three capsules

8
00:00:23.208 --> 00:00:26.291
And when we are all separated...

9
00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:28.416
I understand that there are a few who

10
00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:30.625
don't understand what I'm talking about

11
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.750
There's nothing to be done with them...

12
00:00:35.208 --> 00:00:38.166
But the others, who are distributed into capsules,

13
00:00:38.416 --> 00:00:40.166
we won't become servants there, damn it,

14
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:42.875
we won't be subservient, crawlers,

15
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.750
but we'll engage in a definite struggle there

16
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.208
Declare war there and make the other capsules

17
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.666
Estonian capsules

18
00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:51.458
And those who can't understand...

19
00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:53.333
Do you understand me?

20
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.250
Those who can't understand,

21
00:00:55.416 --> 00:00:56.875
you'll get rid of them too

22
00:00:57.041 --> 00:00:58.208
You'll figure out how to get rid of them,

23
00:00:58.333 --> 00:00:59.500
but damn, don't give up!

24
00:01:00.708 --> 00:01:04.458
So that 23 years from now, there will only be Estonian capsules

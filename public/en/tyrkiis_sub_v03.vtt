00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.583
I'm very psyched about this because

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.250
friends, it's time to see

3
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.541
what you've brought into the capsule.

4
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.708
It's data time, isn't it?

5
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:17.875
17 people have brought sunglasses.

6
00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:20.333
Good idea, we don't know what that bad boy

7
00:00:20.416 --> 00:00:21.833
up there will be doing,

8
00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:23.458
so it's good to protect our eyes.

9
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.666
Headphones.

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.291
Some of us have them, right?

11
00:00:27.458 --> 00:00:28.750
But it's always good to have extra.

12
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:30.916
10 people have brought tracksuits.

13
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.833
I totally understand - comfort is a must.

14
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.708
6 handfuls of hallucinogenic mushrooms.

15
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.875
Yeah... I get it, right?

16
00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:44.458
We're traveling on different levels,

17
00:00:44.583 --> 00:00:45.750
seeking visions there.

18
00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:47.833
But at the same time, let's be very cautious,

19
00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:50.541
addictions hold us back as humans.

20
00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:53.250
They keep us from being creators.

21
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:56.750
So let's use mushrooms very responsibly.

22
00:00:57.708 --> 00:01:00.666
A collection of scientific articles - beautiful, right?

23
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.958
We have to lay the foundation somewhere.

24
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.458
But now, one more concerning thing.

25
00:01:08.291 --> 00:01:11.250
12 revolvers...

26
00:01:12.208 --> 00:01:15.166
Friends, I understand, self-defense, etc.

27
00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.916
But a revolver is a strong symbol of violence.

28
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.250
Are we building a future

29
00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:23.666
where we don't need such nonsense?

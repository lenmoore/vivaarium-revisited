00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.708
Violet: What's going on over there?

2
00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:03.208
Lime: Hello, hello!

3
00:00:03.291 --> 00:00:04.916
Silver: I can't quite understand right now.

4
00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:07.500
The whole capsule here is filled with smoke,

5
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.375
and breathing has become difficult.

6
00:00:10.583 --> 00:00:12.875
In any case... we request, what the heck,

7
00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:14.458
We need to get out of here so that we

8
00:00:14.583 --> 00:00:16.458
can spend some time in your capsules

9
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.625
until this problem here is resolved.

10
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.416
Everywhere is filled with smoke.

11
00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:22.041
This generator is acting up,

12
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.166
the light keeps flickering.

13
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.541
Can you hear me? Do you understand what I'm saying?

14
00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:26.125
Lime: Silver, I warned you

15
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.500
years ago, didn't I?

16
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.625
Turquoise: We're considering it.

17
00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:31.791
Lime: We can't help you, but we're considering

18
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.833
Silver: Listen, if you're considering, damn it,

19
00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.208
then maybe it's already... we're

20
00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:36.708
Estonians, you have to understand,

21
00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:38.125
these capsules are for Estonians' protection.

00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:03.458
Dear friends, as we've heard,

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.750
different capsules hold different ideas,

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.833
a multitude of different views.

4
00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:12.708
Good for them, right?

5
00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.791
But we're moving forward now.

6
00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:18.125
Fun fact - about 230 million years ago,

7
00:00:18.416 --> 00:00:20.958
that's even before dinosaurs,

8
00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:23.125
our home planet received

9
00:00:23.291 --> 00:00:25.333
1-2 million years of rain.

10
00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:27.750
And it caused an unprecedented event

11
00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:30.333
- you heard it right -

12
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:32.708
before the dinosaurs ruled,

13
00:00:32.916 --> 00:00:35.250
other creatures inhabited this planet.

14
00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:36.833
But they went extinct - 

15
00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.291
just like the dinosaurs later did.

16
00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:41.791
Extinction - it's a completely normal

17
00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.291
part of evolution.

18
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.833
It's the most common form of change.

19
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:49.375
Something disappears, something emerges.

20
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.166
What happens if we fiercely resist

21
00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:54.166
these changes?

22
00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:56.041
What then?

23
00:00:56.583 --> 00:00:58.333
We go extinct!

24
00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.166
What if we just give in?

25
00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:02.125
The same - we go extinct.

26
00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:05.875
But if we adapt to the changes,

27
00:01:06.416 --> 00:01:09.000
then life thrives,

28
00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:11.791
evolution happens.

29
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Go with the flow, you know - 

30
00:01:14.083 --> 00:01:15.916
that's the foundation of life!

31
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.166
Life gives you lemons - 

32
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.208
you make limoncello.

33
00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:24.083
At this moment, we are approaching

34
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.208
the extinction of humanity.

35
00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:28.541
As humans, we simply became

36
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:30.750
too successful, you see.

37
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.958
Our species is just too successful!

38
00:01:33.208 --> 00:01:36.125
Consumption, production, human growth

39
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:38.833
has been unprecedented in the last 500 years.

40
00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.916
ASTONISHING!

41
00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:43.541
And every bubble has to burst eventually.

42
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.375
What makes humans so incredibly unique?

43
00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:53.208
Unlike other extinct species on the planet,

44
00:01:53.416 --> 00:01:56.458
humans are not willing to leave quietly.

45
00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:59.333
We're doing our part right now - 

46
00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:02.041
sitting in this capsule for 23 years,

47
00:02:02.208 --> 00:02:05.041
but that doesn't really solve the big problem.

48
00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:08.000
It simply postpones the catastrophe.

49
00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:11.583
So - we need to change something else.

50
00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:15.875
What could that something else be?

51
00:02:16.416 --> 00:02:19.708
Friends, we need to change our mindset!

52
00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:22.125
Shake off all the socially, mentally,

53
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.541
and culturally rigid structures

54
00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:26.500
of past generations.

55
00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:29.666
In the next 20 years, 97% of current jobs

56
00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:34.500
will go extinct.

57
00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:38.000
It's happening all around us right now.

58
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.250
Think about supermarkets - 

59
00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:42.375
how many cashiers are actually working

?

60
00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:45.125
New technologies are

61
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:46.875
faster, more efficient,

62
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.166
and most importantly - 

63
00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:49.500
they never tire.

64
00:02:49.708 --> 00:02:51.916
They don't get sick or ask for a day off

65
00:02:52.083 --> 00:02:55.166
because their daughter has an important exam.

66
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.625
Humans losing to technology -

67
00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:00.833
it's inevitable!

68
00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:02.916
But it's not a bad thing.

69
00:03:03.208 --> 00:03:05.458
It doesn't mean we should disappear.

70
00:03:05.791 --> 00:03:08.416
No! We need to find a new path.

71
00:03:08.708 --> 00:03:11.333
A new direction for growth.

72
00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:16.333
Looking at the incredible brainpower here,

73
00:03:16.833 --> 00:03:20.250
I believe that we, in this capsule,

74
00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:23.041
will find that path!

1
00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:02.916
It's quite entertaining, isn't it?

2
00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:06.416
But we should still consider
how practical and necessary

3
00:00:06.416 --> 00:00:08.291
these video calls will be for us
in the future.

4
00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:10.750
Alright.
The joke's over!

5
00:00:11.083 --> 00:00:12.666
Let's get more specific.

6
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:16.916
In life, we need to differentiate
between things we can change

7
00:00:17.458 --> 00:00:20.166
We can change our hairstyle,
our clothing, even our name

8
00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:22.625
Our place of residence, citizenship

9
00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:26.666
But we cannot change our genetics

10
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.791
We cannot change our basic nature

11
00:00:29.458 --> 00:00:32.625
And we cannot change our gender

12
00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:35.125
Yes, we can change our role

13
00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:40.250
But only when it's necessary
and you're ready for it

14
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:47.833
Did you know that hierarchy is inherent
to every social organism?

15
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.291
The human brain has evolved over millions
of years to recognize hierarchical structures

16
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:55.416
Why?

17
00:00:56.083 --> 00:00:56.875
Because that's how things get done

18
00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:01.541
It allows us to achieve more
with fewer resources

19
00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:04.833
And it enables a small group of people
to maximize their output

20
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.583
So, I can see from your faces, yes...

21
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.500
Of course!

22
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.791
Hierarchy is often discussed as a form of power,

23
00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:22.625
but we should talk about hierarchy as the pragmatic
division of skills.

24
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:28.833
For example, in house construction,
we don't need ten foremen and one laborer.

25
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.208
That won't get us anywhere.

26
00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:35.000
Hierarchy, family, and order
are the only

27
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.250
historical and scientifically
proven methods

28
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.333
for how one tribe can achieve
results.

29
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.583
Now, let's get to specific proposals.

30
00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:48.416
We need to rely on scientific research
and well-developed systems.

31
00:01:49.416 --> 00:01:52.000
Like the Taagepera formula -

32
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.833
Which tells us that a community
should be led by the square root of its population.

33
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.208
In our case, that's rounded to 1.

34
00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:03.333
In this case, it's me.

35
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.125
Scientists have also found that
when finishing high school,

36
00:02:08.125 --> 00:02:11.500
Estonian youth have the most
versatile knowledge.

37
00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:14.708
So, it's important for the development
of our community

38
00:02:14.708 --> 00:02:20.958
to have a significant portion of
18-23-year-olds.

39
00:02:22.416 --> 00:02:24.625
Now, I come to the next
important topic -

40
00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:27.958
Consistency and continuity.

41
00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:30.291
One cannot exist without the other.

42
00:02:30.708 --> 00:02:36.958
So, a certain part of our capsule
must consist of healthy women of childbearing age.

43
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.708
To ensure the population's uniform growth,
each household must produce

44
00:02:41.708 --> 00:02:44.291
at least 3 offspring.

45
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.208
In the family and small community model,
such a family can successfully raise them.

46
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.625
Any individual who is currently available
will be sent to assist some family.

47
00:02:57.458 --> 00:02:59.208
There's a lot to do, but time is limited.

48
00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:03.333
Staying too long in your comfort zone
is neither healthy nor beneficial.

49
00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:06.875
If you respect our schedule,
success will accompany us.

50
00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:14.083
However, if you choose to be lazy, there will be
another, better-organized group that will take advantage of our resources.

51
00:03:14.666 --> 00:03:17.875
And deplete our resources.

52
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.791
Nature abhors a vacuum.

53
00:03:21.416 --> 00:03:25.166
So, within our community,
we need to start making decisions

54
00:03:25.166 --> 00:03:28.375
that will lead us faster to our goal.

55
00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.541
We need to be one step ahead of the rest.

56
00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:35.250
We're not many. We need to ensure
our successors.

57
00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:40.083
To motivate you, I propose -

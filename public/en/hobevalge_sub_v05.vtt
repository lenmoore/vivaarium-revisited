Don't take it personally, just words...

29
00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:23.125
You really can't go wrong with compound words

30
00:01:25.416 --> 00:01:29.541
Compound words are magical because they combine

31
00:01:30.416 --> 00:01:33.333
Our small Estonian nation also needs unity

32
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.416
In achieving this, our land and language play a crucial role

33
00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:39.458
Estonian is a beautiful, rare

34
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.416
and unfortunately, fragile language

35
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:48.750
No nation whose language is restricted

36
00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.375
can fully flourish

37
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.541
We've seen enough of that in dictatorships

38
00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:57.875
Think about higher education, for example

39
00:01:58.125 --> 00:02:01.166
Lately, there's been a lot of debate about whether

40
00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:04.166
Estonian universities should have

41
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.791
programs in the Estonian language

42
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:09.541
because apparently, it won't make it in the world

43
00:02:10.916 --> 00:02:13.416
But that's nonsense

44
00:02:13.708 --> 00:02:16.208
The purpose of university education is... what do you do there?

45
00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:21.500
The purpose of university education is to elevate

46
00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:24.041
LINGUISTICAL

47
00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:26.125
SCIENTIFICAL

48
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.916
and CULTURAL level

49
00:02:28.208 --> 00:02:30.500
The Estonian language needs capability in every aspect of society,

50
00:02:30.708 --> 00:02:33.000
in every field, everywhere

51
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.916
People who argue otherwise

52
00:02:36.083 --> 00:02:38.041
are unintentionally, or even knowingly

54
00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.750
destroying what

55
00:02:39.916 --> 00:02:41.541
Estonian patriots have given their lives for

56
00:02:41.833 --> 00:02:43.791
Do you understand... GIVEN THEIR LIVES FOR

57
00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:47.750
In fact, in high school, elementary school,

58
00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:51.958
primary school, daycare, even in the mother's womb,

59
00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:55.750
the Estonian language should resonate,

60
00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:58.291
because that's the only way

61
00:02:58.541 --> 00:03:00.583
a person develops language skills,

62
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.333
flexibility to think big thoughts in their native language,

63
00:03:03.541 --> 00:03:06.125
to make complex deals

64
00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:09.708
Secondly, our country, Estonia, is one of the few

65
00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:12.916
places where the forests and landscapes have remained

66
00:03:13.208 --> 00:03:16.125
relatively intact as they were when the language developed

67
00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:20.458
Our language is not separate from our forests

68
00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:26.291
For example, you walk by a spring and hear,

69
00:03:31.083 --> 00:03:36.458
how mosquitoes buzz and the creek gurgles

70
00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:40.041
and your feet squish in the soft mud

71
00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:45.416
What do you call what I just did?

72
00:03:46.416 --> 00:03:49.791
When words audibly express nature

73
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.166
Onomatopoeia - very correct

74
00:03:56.416 --> 00:03:59.625
When words audibly express nature

75
00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:01.750
There is no other language in the world

76
00:04:01.916 --> 00:04:03.916
where it is as prevalent as in the Estonian language

77
00:04:04.125 --> 00:04:06.875
Estonia's forests still have many places

78
00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:10.750
where Estonians can truly contemplate

79
00:04:11.208 --> 00:04:13.708
And the Estonian phrase GO TO THE FOREST

80
00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:16.291
is actually a fantastic suggestion

81
00:04:16.583 --> 00:04:18.791
And to let go of such a powerful natural heritage,

82
00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.250
to sell it off - it's the same

83
00:04:21.458 --> 00:04:24.458
destruction as anglicizing university education

84
00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:28.166
If anyone still wants it explained in simple terms,

85
00:04:28.458 --> 00:04:30.250
just take the Estonian constitution - 

86
00:04:30.458 --> 00:04:32.250
Article number 5 says that Estonian

87
00:04:32.416 --> 00:04:35.833
natural resources are a national treasure,

88
00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:38.500
to be used sustainably

89
00:04:38.666 --> 00:04:40.791
Article number 6:

90
00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:43.791
The official language of Estonia is Estonian

91
00:04:44.875 --> 00:04:47.500
And if someone asks: what about minorities?

92
00:04:48.291 --> 00:04:50.916
Take a world map and place it on the table

93
00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:54.750
In the global context, Estonians are a minority

94
00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:56.750
and everyone who comes here is part

95
00:04:56.875 --> 00:04:58.833
of larger ethnic groups

96
00:04:58.916 --> 00:05:00.791
And in this light, it's fair

97
00:05:00.916 --> 00:05:02.875
for them to come here, learn the Estonian language,

98
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.750
get acquainted with Estonian culture

99
00:05:04.875 --> 00:05:06.000
and it's a fair deal.

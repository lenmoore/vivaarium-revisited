1
00:00:00.791 --> 00:00:02.833
I had to just cut off
that video call

2
00:00:04.416 --> 00:00:06.375
I can't stand such
manipulation

3
00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:07.666
I want to protect you!

4
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.416
These three guys think they're
great salesmen

5
00:00:10.416 --> 00:00:13.416
But the stuff they're offering
isn't even fit for the garbage dump

6
00:00:13.416 --> 00:00:17.375
Like the Captain of Turquoise -
a great innovator!

7
00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:19.541
Wants to turn humans into androids

8
00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:24.000
Every new gadget he invents
must immediately interfere in human life

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.166
And later turn the whole world
upside down

10
00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:35.125
But in reality, with them...
it's the fear of missing out

11
00:00:35.916 --> 00:00:38.416
"But what if I can't get
that new Apple phone?"

12
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.125
All of Turquoise's talk can be countered
with just one sentence -

13
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.375
But what happens
if I can't?

14
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.250
The answer is: nothing
happens at all

15
00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:50.541
Turquoise's only goal is to fill
the consciousness of all humanity with noise

16
00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:53.000
So that later they can squeeze money
out of the simpletons

17
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:58.666
These Silverwhites...
they're another extreme.

18
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.750
They're just selling
hot air

19
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.666
Some round legend
of the Estonian spirit

20
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.083
From Kaali Crater,
Kalev's Castle

21
00:01:09.083 --> 00:01:11.333
A damn awakened
limestone

22
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:14.666
Just lying on the shores
of the Baltic Sea, praising the lapping waves

23
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:18.541
Silverwhites like them have nothing
to give to our society

24
00:01:18.833 --> 00:01:20.375
They only consume

25
00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:24.708
Our air, our time,
and our energy

26
00:01:25.416 --> 00:01:28.416
I wouldn't last even 2 minutes
in the same capsule with such parasites

27
00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:34.041
But if the Silverwhites and Turquoises
are a bit annoying

28
00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:37.250
Then they're not
dangerous

29
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:39.333
But the Slanders are

30
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:42.333
They are busy transforming
everyone else

31
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:45.333
You heard it - they've discovered
a theoretical problem

32
00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:47.833
And they're already making
prescriptions for us!

33
00:01:47.833 --> 00:01:50.875
You see, this is the problem with most people

34
00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:52.833
They meddle too much
in other people's business

35
00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:57.041
First, clean up your own house,
learn to walk straight yourself

36
00:01:59.458 --> 00:02:02.375
I apologize to all of you

37
00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:04.541
for cutting off those video calls so late

38
00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:08.125
We still have order and a schedule here

39
00:02:08.125 --> 00:02:12.125
And I don't intend to waste it
on any nonsense

40
00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:16.291
More and more, I'm thinking that when this
Vivarium experiment is over

41
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.958
Then who will walk out
of these capsules?

42
00:02:20.291 --> 00:02:26.333
I am convinced - from our capsule,
a well-functioning core group will emerge

43
00:02:27.208 --> 00:02:29.000
A geometric circle

44
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The world's strongest shape

45
00:02:31.875 --> 00:02:36.291
But the other three will limp out at best
as war veterans

46
00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:43.041
At worst, the capsules will only emit
a foul stench

47
00:02:44.083 --> 00:02:47.791
Our mission on this planet has never
been as important as it is now

48
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:49.250
Without us, the world is doomed

49
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.250
We won't spend any more time
on these video calls

50
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.291
We must make significant decisions
within our community

51
00:02:56.291 --> 00:02:57.875
We must become more drastic

52
00:02:57.875 --> 00:03:01.875
And we must collectively
commit to a common goal

53
00:03:05.416 --> 00:03:08.708
Single people do not fulfill this goal

54
00:03:11.083 --> 00:03:15.958
They are driven by selfishness
and plagued by instability

55
00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.541
To motivate them...

56
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:25.708
I propose voting on
an important topic

57
00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:30.458
We take away the voting rights
of single individuals

58
00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:34.541
Because childish behavior excludes
the privileges of an adult

59
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.458
But this wouldn't be
an irreversible decision

60
00:03:37.458 --> 00:03:40.291
If a person wants voting rights,
they'll find a partner

61
00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:42.000
Dedicate themselves to their role

62
00:03:43.583 --> 00:03:45.458
And everything will be fine again!

63
00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:46.958
Let's vote!

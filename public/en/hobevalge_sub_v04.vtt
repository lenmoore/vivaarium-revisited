00:00:02.125 --> 00:00:05.333
Look, when it comes to these capsules 

2
00:00:05.541 --> 00:00:08.125
and this whole experiment,

3
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.916
I immediately felt such a pull

4
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.708
and I was sure that when the experts

5
00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:16.416
assemble these groups here and

6
00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.958
select people based on different criteria,

7
00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:23.000
so that the tallest, fastest,

8
00:00:23.208 --> 00:00:26.666
strongest, and smartest get on the boat,

9
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:29.375
the most important thing is forgotten -

10
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:32.125
our spirit

11
00:00:32.416 --> 00:00:35.416
The whole world is full of faster and smarter people

12
00:00:35.708 --> 00:00:38.708
but what would this world become if only they were allowed

13
00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.041
It would start to strongly resemble breeding of purebred dogs

14
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.833
All the effort would go into increasing numbers

15
00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:48.125
Continuous growth, growth, growth...

16
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:50.333
Economic model, the end of an economic model

17
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:53.000
Why the hell to grow this world

18
00:00:53.291 --> 00:00:55.625
if there's nothing inside?

19
00:00:56.208 --> 00:00:58.833
Dear friends, we take care of this,

20
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.958
whatever the developments may be,

21
00:01:01.208 --> 00:01:03.583
whatever decisions are made,

22
00:01:03.791 --> 00:01:06.666
the Estonian remains in this melting pot

23
00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:10.291
We take care of it so that in a couple of years

24
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.416
you don't have to go to a science lab

25
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:15.000
to watch the last Estonian behind glass

26
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:18.333
We persist in holding onto what makes us us,

27
00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:21.791
what defines us

28
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:26.083
Dear friends, let's take these smart ones out

29
00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:28.916
and I'll activate some questions for you,

30
00:01:29.083 --> 00:01:31.166
so we can understand how well or

31
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:33.000
similarly we think about Estonia

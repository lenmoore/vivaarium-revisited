1
00:00:00.791 --> 00:00:04.583
Sorry... It completely slipped through my fingers, didn't it?

2
00:00:05.583 --> 00:00:08.291
But you see, my friends, that's how it happens.

3
00:00:08.458 --> 00:00:11.166
When you get stuck in the structures of the old world.

4
00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:14.083
It's not about having a common discussion,

5
00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:17.375
but rather about pushing your rigid beliefs.

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.791
Captain Lime, he thinks he can

7
00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:23.416
predict the future better than the rest of us.

8
00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:25.125
He's such a classic.

9
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.166
Narrow-minded, average Joe.

10
00:00:27.708 --> 00:00:29.625
What's the point of fostering paranoia?

11
00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:32.208
You have to be prepared for change!

12
00:00:32.416 --> 00:00:33.750
You have to adapt!

13
00:00:33.916 --> 00:00:34.750
But of course, instead of changing themselves,

14
00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:36.458
these brothers are busy changing others.

15
00:00:36.708 --> 00:00:38.625
Their focus is completely misplaced!

16
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.583
They're engaged in a fierce battle to save the planet.

17
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:44.125
The planet doesn't need saving.

18
00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:46.125
We need saving!

19
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.833
People from each other,

20
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.583
from the clutches of such dictators.

21
00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.666
The only mindset of the Lime-like folks is:

22
00:00:52.791 --> 00:00:54.166
Take a step back!

23
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.625
Give up fuel! Abandon infrastructure!

24
00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:57.833
For heaven's sake, don't wash yourself!

25
00:00:58.083 --> 00:01:00.125
Asceticism for the masses!

26
00:01:00.416 --> 00:01:01.916
That's not the solution.

27
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.000
Innovation is the solution,

28
00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:04.875
we must move forward.

29
00:01:05.083 --> 00:01:06.916
Create your own reality!

30
00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:09.583
But those other two aren't any better.

31
00:01:09.791 --> 00:01:11.583
Captain Silver-like,

32
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.250
straw hat on his head, lyre in hand,

33
00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:15.125
boom - back to the 19th century.

34
00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:17.958
And this talk about Estonian uniqueness...

35
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:22.041
Nationalism - a very cool concept

36
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.833
Recently, about 200 years ago,

37
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.500
it was super innovative, but

38
00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:28.958
in today's global interconnected reality,

39
00:01:29.083 --> 00:01:31.666
that crap - it won't last long.

40
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:35.125
The most important part of my identity is not my nationality.

41
00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:37.416
I wasn't born to love kama,

42
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.541
just because I happened to be born in Estonia.

43
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.125
I create my identity for myself.

44
00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:47.708
Sorry, I don't want to sound like a Violet Karen,

45
00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:49.833
and I can imagine this chick

46
00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:51.833
waking up in the morning just

47
00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:53.875
to start a fight with her own reflection.

48
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:57.416
Not everything in this world is a 24/7 battle.

49
00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.208
It's fundamentally wrong to base your entire

50
00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:02.250
life philosophy on opposition.

51
00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:04.333
Listen to me very carefully now!

52
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.041
We don't live in a world of finite resources.

53
00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:11.250
We live in a world of changing resources.

54
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.625
And these resources are available to everyone

55
00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:15.958
who wants to seek them out.

56
00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:18.291
What unites all three of them?

57
00:02:18.708 --> 00:02:20.833
They're all stuck in the past.

58
00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:23.333
And that's just sad!

59
00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:26.708
They make up that 99% of the population

60
00:02:26.916 --> 00:02:30.000
that really isn't ready to change.

61
00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:33.958
So what the heck?

62
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.333
We are! And we're moving forward!

63
00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:39.166
A few days ago,

64
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:40.833
I had a rather radical idea,

65
00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.208
but I suppressed it because

66
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.750
friends, I had faith!

67
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.250
I had hope for the other capsules.

68
00:02:48.708 --> 00:02:51.708
But based on today's video call, I can clearly see

69
00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:54.625
that the future - it's only for the chosen ones.

70
00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:56.333
The future belongs to those who are

71
00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:57.916
truly capable of change.

72
00:02:58.125 --> 00:02:59.666
The future is for the creators.

73
00:02:59.916 --> 00:03:02.958
The future is right here in this capsule.

74
00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:06.416
And all the rest of that 99%,

75
00:03:06.708 --> 00:03:10.250
the other capsules, the meaningless organic mass,

76
00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:13.500
they are dying out.

77
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.583
Let's not allow their extinction to be in vain.

78
00:03:17.916 --> 00:03:20.708
To sustain our

79
00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:23.083
future virtual producer,

80
00:03:23.208 --> 00:03:26.083
we need a super server, that's clear as day.

81
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.000
Now, as the rest of the world,

82
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.333
the other capsules are concluding their existence

83
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:33.208
on this planet, we must

84
00:03:33.375 --> 00:03:35.041
find a way to turn

85
00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:37.333
those useless remnants

86
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.791
from organic shells - bodies

87
00:03:41.208 --> 00:03:44.583
for our super server's energy needs.

88
00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:46.583
More specifically, we need to start creating

89
00:03:46.708 --> 00:03:48.291
an energy generator that transforms

90
00:03:48.458 --> 00:03:51.250
organic mass, corpses,

91
00:03:51.583 --> 00:03:53.708
into clean energy.

92
00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:55.041
We need to start creating

93
00:03:55.208 --> 00:03:56.750
Vivarium energy,

94
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
or Vivagy.

95
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:00.708
I ask that we take out our smartphones

96
00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:02.125
and start voting on this matter.
